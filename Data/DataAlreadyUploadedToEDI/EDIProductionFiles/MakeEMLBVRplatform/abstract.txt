We monitored water quality in Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA) with high-frequency (10-minute) sensors in 2020. Beaverdam Reservoir is owned and managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority as a secondary drinking water source for Roanoke, Virginia. Depth profiles of water temperature were measured on ~1-meter intervals from above the surface of the reservoir to 0.5 m above the sediments on an anchored thermistor chain to account for water level fluctuations. Dissolved oxygen was monitored at 1.5 m, in the mid-water column at 3.3-4.7 m depth and bottom waters at 0.5 m above the sediments, which corresponded to 10.65-11.98 m depth. A YSI EXO2 sonde measured temperature, conductivity, specific conductance, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter at ~1.5 m depth. Due to variable water levels in the reservoir, the position of some sensors are held stationary to the sediments and presented as positions (thermistor temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pressure sensor), whereas the EXO sonde variables (temperature, dissolved oxygen, pressure, conductivity, specific conductance, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, total dissolved solids, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter) were deployed with a buoy to remain fixed at 1.5 m depth from the water's surface. All variables were measured at the deepest site of the reservoir adjacent to the dam.
