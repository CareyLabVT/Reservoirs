This data package includes bathymetric data and watershed delineations for Falling Creek (FCR), Beaverdam (BVR), and Carvins Cove (CCR) Reservoirs, all located near Roanoke, VA, USA. Bathymetric data were collected using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and processed using WinRiver II and ArcGIS. Water level can vary in these reservoirs; at the time of ADCP measurement, maximum depth was ~9.3 m in FCR, ~13.5 m in BVR, and ~23 m in CCR. Bathymetric data are presented in two forms: (1) as hypsometric summaries of surface area and volume for 0.3-1.0 m depth intervals (for all three reservoirs) and (2) as spatially-explicit shapefiles (BVR and FCR) and triangular irregular networks (TIN) files (FCR and CCR). Watershed areas are included as shapefiles for each reservoir.
