The WVWA oversaw and supported bathymetry collection in its three reservoirs. MKK, EMT, and RLK led ADCP measurement and analysis in BVR and FCR with guidance from DWH and ABP. KAB led ADCP measurements and analysis in CCR with help from JCL, CCC, and DWH. Watershed delineations were led by DWH (CCR) and WMW (FCR + BVR). CCC, DWH, and ABP led coordinated data documentation and publication.
