Bathymetry

Bathymetric data for Falling Creek Reservoir, Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, VA, USA), and Carvins Cove Reservoir (Roanoke, VA, USA) were estimated following standard methods (e.g., Wahl and Vermeyen 1998). All three reservoirs are owned and operated as either primary (FCR and CCR) or secondary (BVR) drinking water supplies by the Western Virginia Water Authority (WVWA). The data were collected using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP; RD Instruments, San Diego, CA, USA) operated from a moving boat when both reservoirs were at full pond: ~10.1 m for Falling Creek Reservoir, ~11 m for Beaverdam Reservoir, and ~23 m for Carvins Cove Reservoir. Global positioning system (DSM 232 GPS Receiver, Trimble) data were collected simultaneously with the ADCP data collection over multiple transects across both waterbodies. Data from Carvins Cove Reservoir were collected in summer/fall 2012. Data from Falling Creek Reservoir were collected in July 2023 and from Beaverdam Reservoir in April 2024.  The ADCP and GPS data were processed using WinRiver II software (RD Instruments) and USGS Velocity Mapping Toolbox. To determine hypsometric contours, summary statistics were generated using the Surface Volume (3D Analyst) tool in the 3D Analyst Toolbox in ArcGIS (Esri, Redlands, CA, USA). The data are presented as hypsometric relationships of surface area and volume for 0.3-1.0 m depth intervals in the two reservoirs, as well as in spatially-explicit shapefiles and triangular irregular networks (TIN) files. FCR and BVR spatial bathymetry files use the D North American 1983 coordinate system. CCR spatial bathymetry files use the WGS 1984 UTM Zone 17N coordinate system. 
A comprehensive document outlining the standard operating procedure for the ADCP - from ADCP setup to post data processing - is available (file ADCP_SOP.pdf). 
A script, titled Bathymetry_Maps_in_R.Rmd, is included and can be used to produce a bathymetric map in leaflet in RStudio. It uses ADCP depth data that has been processed in VMT, converts the points to NAD 1983 UTM zone 17N, and generates a raster. The raster is then used to create the map, as well as calculate surface area and volume according to equations from Manual of Fisheries Survey Methods II (Taube, 2000). 
The ArcGIS files included in this package, allow users to create a detailed bathymetric map of all three reservoirs from various shapefiles and TIN files. Note that the Virginia Rivers and Streams shapefiles were retrieved from the NHDPlus dataset from the USGS TNM Downloader V2, and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data was obtained through Virginia LiDAR download application. 


Watershed

Watershed delineation for CCR was conducted using the StreamStats basin delineation tool provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS; https://streamstats.usgs.gov/ss/). Watershed delineation for FCR and BVR was conducted within ArcGIS Pro using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer 15 second global digital elevation mode (NASA ASTER GDEM) and the HydroSHEDS stream network layer (Lehner et al. 2008) following the method outlined in Merwade (2012). FCR and BVR watershed files use the D North American 1983 coordinate system. CCR watershed files use the WGS 1984 coordinate system.
