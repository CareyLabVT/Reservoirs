This data package includes bathymetric data for Falling Creek and Beaverdam Reservoirs, both located in Vinton, VA, USA. Bathymetric data were collected using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and processed using WinRiver II and ArcGIS. Water level can vary in these reservoirs; at the time of sampling, maximum depth in FCR was ~9.3 m and maximum depth in BVR was ~13.5 m. The data are presented as hypsometric relationships of surface area and volume for 0.3-1.0 m depth intervals in the two reservoirs.
