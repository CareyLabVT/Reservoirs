Depth profiles of water column dissolved methane (CH4), density and biomass of zooplankton (specifically, Chaoborus spp.), and measurements of methane extracted from the tracheal gas sacs of Chaoborus spp. were collected from Beaverdam Reservoir, Vinton, VA, USA during two, 24-hr intensive sampling efforts in fall 2016 (3-4 August and 16-17 September). The sampling campaign was designed to test the hypothesis that Chaoborus spp. can transport CH4 from the hypolimnion to the epilimnion of lakes and reservoirs as they migrate to the surface waters from the benthos at night in search of zooplankton prey, and results of the project are published in Carey et al. 2018. During both sampling events, depth profiles of water column methane and Chaoborus spp. density were collected at noon, dusk, midnight, 2 a.m., dawn, and noon the following day at a 1 m resolution. In addition, during the September sampling event depth profiles were collected 1 hour prior to and after dusk. Methane gas was extracted from live Chaoborus individuals at every depth and time point immediately after collection via gentle centrifugation in distilled water following McGinnis et al. 2017.
