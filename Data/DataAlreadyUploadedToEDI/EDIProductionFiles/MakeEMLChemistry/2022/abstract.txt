Depth profiles of dissolved organic carbon and total and dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus were sampled from 2013 to 2022 in five drinking water reservoirs in southwestern Virginia, USA. Some additional total nitrogen and phosphorus samples from January to April 2022 are included in this data product. The five drinking water reservoirs are: Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia), Carvins Cove Reservoir (Roanoke, Virginia), Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia), Gatewood Reservoir (Pulaski, Virginia), and Spring Hollow Reservoir (Salem, Virginia). Beaverdam, Carvins Cove, Falling Creek, and Spring Hollow Reservoirs are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority as primary or secondary drinking water sources for Roanoke, Virginia, and Gatewood Reservoir is a drinking water source for the town of Pulaski, Virginia. The dataset consists of depth profiles of water chemistry samples measured at the deepest site of each reservoir adjacent to the dam. Additional water chemistry samples were collected at a gauged weir on Falling Creek Reservoir's primary inflow tributary, as well as surface samples at multiple upstream and inflow sites in Falling Creek Reservoir and Beaverdam Reservoir in 2019 and 2020. Inflow sites at Carvins Cove Reservoir were sampled from 2020 - 2022. The water column samples were collected approximately fortnightly from March-April, weekly from May-October, and monthly from November-February at Falling Creek Reservoir and Beaverdam Reservoir, approximately fortnightly from May-August in most years at Carvins Cove Reservoir, and approximately fortnightly from 2014-2016 in Gatewood and Spring Hollow Reservoirs, though sampling frequency and duration varied among reservoirs and years. Depth profiles of dissolved inorganic carbon were also collected from 2018-2021, but the analytical method for this analyte is still in development and these should be considered as preliminary data only.
