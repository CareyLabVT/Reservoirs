Depth profiles of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon and total and dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus were sampled from 2013-2024 in five drinking water reservoirs in southwestern Virginia, USA. The five drinking water reservoirs are: Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia), Carvins Cove Reservoir (Roanoke, Virginia), Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia), Gatewood Reservoir (Pulaski, Virginia), and Spring Hollow Reservoir (Salem, Virginia). Beaverdam, Carvins Cove, Falling Creek, and Spring Hollow Reservoirs are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority as primary or secondary drinking water sources for Roanoke, Virginia, and Gatewood Reservoir is a drinking water source for the town of Pulaski, Virginia. The dataset consists of depth profiles of water chemistry samples measured at the deepest site of each reservoir adjacent to the dam. Additional water chemistry samples were collected at a gauged weir on Falling Creek Reservoir's primary inflow tributary, as well as multiple upstream, inflow, and outflow sites at Falling Creek Reservoir 2014-2024 and Beaverdam Reservoir in 2019, 2020, and 2022. Inflow sites at Carvins Cove Reservoir were sampled from 2020-2024, and additional within-reservoir sites were sampled in 2021-2024. The water column samples at Falling Creek Reservoir and Beaverdam Reservoir were collected approximately fortnightly from March-April, weekly from May-October, and monthly from November-February. Water column samples at Carvins Cove Reservoir were collected approximately fortnightly from May-August in most years, and approximately fortnightly from 2014-2016 in Gatewood and Spring Hollow Reservoirs, though sampling frequency and duration varied among reservoirs and years. A few additional samples collected in 2025 from Falling Creek Reservoir and Carvins Cove Reservoir are included in this dataset as they were analyzed with 2024 samples.
