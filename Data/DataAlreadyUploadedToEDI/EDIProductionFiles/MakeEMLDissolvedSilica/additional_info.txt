In 2014, multiple whole-ecosystem manipulations were conducted at Falling Creek Reservoir. These manipulations include intermittent operation of hypolimnetic oxygenation. For a detailed description of the hypolimnetic oxygenation engineered system, see Gerling et al. (2014). These systems were operated in 2014 following Table 1 in Gerling et al. (2016).
