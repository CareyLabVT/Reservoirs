Depth profiles and surface dissolved samples analyzed for optical analyses (absorbance, fluorescence) were sampled from 2019 to 2020 in two drinking water reservoirs located in southwestern Virginia, USA including Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia) and Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia). Both reservoirs are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority as either primary or secondary drinking water sources for Roanoke, Virginia. The dataset consists of depth profiles for dissolved optical samples (absorbance, fluorescence) measured at the deepest site of each reservoir adjacent to the dam. In addition, surface water samples were collected at a gauged weir on Falling Creek Reservoir's primary inflow tributary as well as the inflow from a wetland located at the head of the reservoir. Surface samples were also collected from multiple upstream inflow and reservoir sites at Falling Creek Reservoir and Beaverdam Reservoir. Depth profiles, gauged weir, and wetland samples were collected approximately fortnightly throughout the summer stratified period (June 2019 - November 2019) and surface samples were collected approximately monthly from May 2019 to October 2019 and in March 2020. Absorbance was measured as colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) using a spectrophotometer. Fluorescence was measured as fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM) using a spectrofluorometer as excitation emission matrices (EEMs). Absorbance and fluorescence results are reported along with PARAFAC model results applied to the collected EEMs samples.
