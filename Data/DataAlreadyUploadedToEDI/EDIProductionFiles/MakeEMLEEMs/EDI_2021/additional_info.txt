In 2019, multiple whole-ecosystem manipulations were conducted at Falling Creek Reservoir. These manipulations include intermittent operation of hypolimnetic oxygenation. For a detailed description of the hypolimnetic oxygenation engineered system (HOx), see Gerling et al. (2014). In 2019, the HOx was activated during the following time periods: 3 June to 17 June; 8 July to 19 July; 5 August to 19 August; and 2 September to 1 December.
