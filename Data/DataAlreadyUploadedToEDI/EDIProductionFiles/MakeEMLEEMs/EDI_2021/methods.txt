FIELD COLLECTION AND SAMPLE STORAGE

Routine depth samples collected for optical analyses (absorbance, fluorescence) were collected at specified depths at the deepest site of each reservoir located adjacent to the dam using a 4L Van Dorn water sampler (Wildco, Yulee, Florida, USA) and were immediately syringe filtered through a combusted (450 deg C, 4+ hours) 0.7 micron nominal poresize GF/F (glass fiber filter) into combusted (450 deg C, 4+ hours) 20 mL glass scintillation vial. Collected samples were immediately placed into a dark bag (covered in duct tape to prevent light infiltration) and stored on ice for transport to the lab (within 6 hours of collection). Surface samples were directly collected from the surface water and syringe filtered, stored, and transported as described for the depths samples above. Samples were stored frozen, on their side, for up to 12 months prior to analysis.

SAMPLE ANALYSIS

Prior to analysis, frozen samples were thawed to room temperature in a dark bag (covered in duct tape to prevent light infiltration) for up to 8 hours before absorbance and fluorescence analysis as described below. Both the spectrophotometer (absorbance) and spectrofluorometer (fluorescence) were allowed to 'warm-up' for at least 30 minutes prior to use at the beginning of each analysis day. Following warm-up, the spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1800) was reset to baseline and autozeroed using Nanopure water. Samples were analyzed from 190 to 850 nm. A Nanopure blank was scanned at the beginning of each day (following baseline and auto zero corrections) and used as a blank correction. Samples with raw Absorbance greater than 0.4 at 240 nm were diluted to account for inner-filtering effects (Murphy et al. 2013).

Immediately following analysis on the spectrophotometer, samples were analyzed on a spectrofluorometer (Horiba FluoroMax-3) to measure fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM) as excitation emission matrices (EEMs). Samples were scanned at 240 nm to 450 nm every 5 nm for the excitation spectrum and at 300 nm to 600 nm every 2 nm for the emission spectrum. At the beginning of each day, following instrument warm-up and prior to sample analysis, instrument checks were performed, including a Xenon Lamp check, Cuvette check, and Raman check. For the Xenon Lamp check, with an empty sample chamber, the spectrofluorometer scanned at 200 nm to 600 nm every 1 nm for the excitation spectrum and at 350 nm for the emission spectrum, looking for the highest peak to occur at 467 nm to ensure the lamp was operating appropriately. For the cuvette check, a cuvette filled with Nanopure water was placed in the sample chamber. The spectrofluorometer scanned at 240 nm for the excitation spectrum and 270 nm to 430 nm every 2 nm for the emission spectrum. The location of maximum intensity was recorded with an expected maximum intensity of ~50,000 counts per second (CPS) or less to check for any potential contamination on the quartz cuvette. For the Raman check, the spectrofluorometer scanned at 350 nm for the excitation spectrum and 365 to 450 nm every 1 nm for the emission spectrum using a Nanopure blank. The location of the peak and maximum intensity were recorded with an expected peak at 397 nm and a maximum intensity of ~400,000 CPS. The Raman check was also used in the data correction and processing as described below. Following the instrument checks, a Nanopure Blank was analyzed (Ex = 240 to 450 nm every 5 nm; Em = 300 to 600 nm every 2 nm) which was used as the blank correction. Samples were then analyzed immediately following analysis on the spectrophotometer as described above.

DATA CORRECTION AND PROCESSING

The absorbance data from the spectrophotometer were corrected for each sample by first, subtracting the daily Nanopure blank from each sample scan. Absorbance values (A254) were converted to naperian coefficients (a254) using  the equation: a254=2.303*A254/l where l is the cuvette pathlength (0.01 m, Stedmon and Nelson 2015). The value of a254 and a350 at wavelengths 254 and 350, respectively are reported. The natural log was taken for each naperian coefficient from wavelengths 190 to 850 nm. The natural log values between wavelengths 275 nm to 295 nm were averaged (S275_295), as well as the natural log values between wavelengths 350 nm and 400 nm (S350_400). The slope ratio (SR) was calculated by dividing the two previously calculated averages, 275-295/350-400 (Helms et al. 2008). All instances where replicates were collected and analyzed are reported in this dataset. CSV files used to correct the absorbance data are published with this data product in the Corrected_CDOM zipped folder.

Fluorescence samples were blank-corrected using a Nanopure blank collected on the same day as analysis. Instrument excitation and emission corrections were applied to each blank-corrected sample in addition to corrections for inner-filtering effects using the absorbance scan collected on the same day of analysis, and calibrated against the Raman signal of Nanopure water using an in-house Matlab script. Emission scans for each sample were concatenated into 151 x 43 excitation-emission matrices (EEMs). Peaks B (Ex: 275, Em: 305), T (Ex: 275, Em: 340), A (Ex: 260, Em: 400-460), C (Ex: 320-360, Em: 420-460), M (Ex:290-310 , Em: 370-410), and N (Ex: 280, Em: 370) were identified based on existing literature (Coble, 2007; Fellman et al. 2010, and references within). The fluorescence index (FI) was calculated as the ratio between emission wavelengths measured at 450 nm and 500 nm at an excitation of 370 nm (McKnight et al. 2001). BIX was calculated as the ratio between the beta (380 nm, Peak M) and alpha (430 nm, Peak C) regions of fluorescence measured at an excitation wavelength of 310 nm (Huguet et al. 2009). HIX was calculated as the ratio of the H (435-480 nm) and L (300-345 nm) regions of fluorescence measured at an excitation wavelength of 254 nm (Huguet et al. 2009). Peak ratios (T_B, T_M, T_N, T_C, A_T, A_C, A_M, M_C, C_N) were calculated by dividing the respective peak intensities. Samples with dilution 1 or 2 are reported in this dataset.

PARAFAC MODELING

Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) is a multiway, statistical decomposition technique that can be applied to a collection of EEMs to identify and track broad classes of fDOM, represented as linearly independent components having excitation and emission properties common to organic fluorophores. A PARAFAC model was fitted to a total of 250 samples collected from both reservoirs (Falling Creek Reservoir and Beaverdam Reservoir) at all stations and depths using the drEEM toolbox in Matlab (Murphy et al. 2013). EEMs were normalized to their total fluorescence prior to PARAFAC modeling. A 4-component PARAFAC model was fitted to the collected DOM samples. The model was split-half validated following Murphy et al. 2013. Samples were reverse-normalized and Fmax values for each component and sample were calculated by multiplying the maximum excitation loading and emission loading for each component by its model score (Murphy et al. 2013). Corrected EEMs files used in the PARAFAC model are included in the EEMs_pfiles zipped folder associated with this data publication. The matlab script used to fit the PARAFAC model is also included (PARAFAC_Mod.m).

Identified components were compared to previously published PARAFAC spectra on OpenFluor (Murphy et al. 2014). Component 1 (C1) matched with 19 other spectra on OpenFluor and was identified as ubiquitous, terrestrial, humic-like Peaks A and C (DeFrancesco and Gueguen, 2021; Catalan et al. 2020; Derrien et al. 2020). Component 2 (C2) matched with 22 other spectra on OpenFluor and was identified as humic-like, fulvic-acid, peak C (Yamashita et al. 2011; Goncalves-Araujo et al. 2015; Murphy et al. 2008). Component 3 (C3) matched with 1 other spectra on OpenFluor and was identified as humic-like DOM (humic-like DOM). FInally, component 4 (C4) matched with 17 other spectra and was identified as protein-like DOM (Zhou et al. 2019; Dainard et al. 2015; Wauthy et al. 2018). The output from OpenFluor is included in the data publication.

All data (absorbance, fluorescence, PARAFAC model results) were collated, QA/QC'd, and formatted for publication using the Abs_QA_QC.R script included in the publication.
