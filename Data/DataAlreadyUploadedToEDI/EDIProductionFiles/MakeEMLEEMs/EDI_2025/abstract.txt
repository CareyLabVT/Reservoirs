Depth profiles and surface dissolved samples analyzed for optical analyses (absorbance, fluorescence) were sampled from 2019 to 2025 in three drinking water reservoirs located in southwestern Virginia, USA including Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia), Carvins Cove Reservoir (Roanoke, Virginia), and Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia). The reservoirs are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority as either primary or secondary drinking water sources for Roanoke, Virginia. The dataset consists of depth profiles at the deepest site of each reservoir, surface water samples from reservoir tributaries, and additional samples at within-reservoir sites. In Beaverdam and Falling Creek Reservoir, we collected depth profiles, gauged weir, and wetland samples approximately fortnightly throughout the summer stratified period (June 2019 - November 2019) and surface samples approximately monthly from May 2019 to October 2019 and in March 2020. Beaverdam Reservoir depth samples were additionally collected in summer 2022. We collected depth profiles and tributary samples monthly to seasonally in Carvins Cove Reservoir from late 2021 - 2023. From May 2024 - April 2025, we sampled depth profiles at multiple transects across the reservoir and surface water samples in one tributary approximately monthly at Carvins Cove. Absorbance was measured as colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) using a spectrophotometer. Fluorescence was measured as fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM) using a spectrofluorometer as excitation emission matrices (EEMs). Absorbance and fluorescence results are reported along with PARAFAC model results applied to the collected EEMs samples. Data visualization and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) scripts accompany the data package.
