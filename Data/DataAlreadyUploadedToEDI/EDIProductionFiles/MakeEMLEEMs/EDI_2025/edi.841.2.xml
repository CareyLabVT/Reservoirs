    <abstract>
      <para>Depth profiles and surface dissolved samples analyzed for optical analyses (absorbance, fluorescence) were sampled from 2019 to 2025 in three drinking water reservoirs located in southwestern Virginia, USA including Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia), Carvins Cove Reservoir (Roanoke, Virginia), and Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia). The reservoirs are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority as either primary or secondary drinking water sources for Roanoke, Virginia. The dataset consists of depth profiles at the deepest site of each reservoir, surface water samples from reservoir tributaries, and additional samples at within-reservoir sites. In Beaverdam and Falling Creek Reservoir, we collected depth profiles, gauged weir, and wetland samples approximately fortnightly throughout the summer stratified period (June 2019 - November 2019) and surface samples approximately monthly from May 2019 to October 2019 and in March 2020. Beaverdam Reservoir depth samples were additionally collected in summer 2022. We collected depth profiles and tributary samples monthly to seasonally in Carvins Cove Reservoir from late 2021 - 2023. From May 2024 - April 2025, we sampled depth profiles at multiple transects across the reservoir and surface water samples in one tributary approximately monthly at Carvins Cove. Absorbance was measured as colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) using a spectrophotometer. Fluorescence was measured as fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM) using a spectrofluorometer as excitation emission matrices (EEMs). Absorbance and fluorescence results are reported along with PARAFAC model results applied to the collected EEMs samples. Data visualization and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) scripts accompany the data package.</para>

        <description>
          <para>We quantified dissolved organic matter composition using optical analyses (absorbance and fluorescence) at three freshwater reservoirs and their tributaries in southwestern, Virginia, USA from 2019-2025. The three drinking water reservoirs are: Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia), Carvins Cove Reservoir (Roanoke, Virginia), and Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia), which are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority as primary or secondary drinking water sources for Roanoke, Virginia. </para>
          <para>The dataset consists of surface water samples and depth profiles of absorbance and fluorescence samples measured at several sites across the reservoir (for detailed site descriptions see 'site_descriptions.csv'). Depth profiles at the deepest site in Beaverdam Reservoir and Falling Creek Reservoir were collected approximately fortnightly in summer 2019, with monthly sampling at tributaries and surface water samples of upstream reservoir sites collected from April 2019 - October 2019, and in March 2020. Beaverdam Reservoir was additionally sampled between May and July 2022 at the deepest site. Depth profiles at the deepest site of Carvins Cove Reservoir and surface water samples in several tributaries were collected monthly to seasonally from September 2021 to August 2023. A transect from one tributary to the deepest site of Carvins Cove was sampled approximately monthly from April 2024 - May 2025 with depth profiles collected at within-reservoir sites. All sample times are reported in the local time they were collected (either EST or EDT), if time was not recorded, the time has been set to noon and flagged in the Flag_DateTime column.</para>
          <para>Below, we describe sample collection methods, chemical analyses including equipment, QAQC methods, and additional references.</para>
          <para>FIELD COLLECTION AND SAMPLE STORAGE</para>
          <para>Depth samples for optical analyses (absorbance, fluorescence) were collected at specified depths using a 4-L Van Dorn water sampler (Wildco, Yulee, Florida, USA) and were immediately syringe-filtered through a combusted (450 deg C, 4+ hours) 0.7-micron nominal poresize GF/F (glass fiber filter) into combusted (450 deg C, 4+ hours) 20-mL glass scintillation vial. Collected samples were immediately placed into a dark bag (covered in duct tape to prevent light infiltration) and stored on ice for transport to the lab (within 6 hours of collection). Surface samples were directly collected from the surface water and syringe filtered, stored, and transported as described for the depths samples above. Samples were stored frozen, on their side, for up to 12 months prior to analysis.</para>
          <para>SAMPLE ANALYSIS</para>
          <para>Prior to analysis, frozen samples were thawed to room temperature in a dark bag (covered in duct tape to prevent light infiltration) for up to 8 hours before absorbance and fluorescence analysis as described below. Both the spectrophotometer (absorbance) and spectrofluorometer (fluorescence) were allowed to 'warm-up' for at least 30 minutes prior to use at the beginning of each analysis day. Following warm-up, the spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1800) was reset to baseline using the 'Baseline' function with an empty sample chamber then autozeroed using Nanopure water. Samples were analyzed from 190 to 850 nm. A Nanopure blank was scanned at the beginning of each day (following baseline and auto zero corrections) and used as a blank correction. Samples with raw Absorbance greater than 0.4 at 240 nm were diluted to account for inner-filtering effects (Murphy et al. 2013).</para>
          <para>Immediately following analysis on the spectrophotometer, samples were analyzed on a spectrofluorometer (Horiba FluoroMax-4) to measure fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM) as excitation emission matrices (EEMs). Samples were scanned at 240 nm to 450 nm every 5 nm for the excitation spectrum and at 300 nm to 600 nm every 2 nm for the emission spectrum. At the beginning of each day, following instrument warm-up and prior to sample analysis, instrument checks were performed, including a Xenon Lamp check, Cuvette check, and Raman check. For the Xenon Lamp check, with an empty sample chamber, the spectrofluorometer scanned at 200 nm to 600 nm every 1 nm for the excitation spectrum and at 350 nm for the emission spectrum, looking for the highest peak to occur at 467 nm to ensure the lamp was operating appropriately. For the cuvette check, a cuvette filled with Nanopure water was placed in the sample chamber. The spectrofluorometer scanned at 240 nm for the excitation spectrum and 270 nm to 430 nm every 2 nm for the emission spectrum. The location of maximum intensity was recorded with an expected maximum intensity of ~50,000 counts per second (CPS) or less to check for any potential contamination on the quartz cuvette. For the Raman check, the spectrofluorometer scanned at 350 nm for the excitation spectrum and 365 to 450 nm every 1 nm for the emission spectrum using a Nanopure blank. The location of the peak and maximum intensity were recorded with an expected peak at 397 nm and a maximum intensity of ~400,000 CPS. The Raman check was also used in the data correction and processing as described below. Following the instrument checks, a Nanopure Blank was analyzed (Ex = 240 to 450 nm every 5 nm; Em = 300 to 600 nm every 2 nm) which was used as the blank correction. Samples were then analyzed immediately following analysis on the spectrophotometer as described above.</para>
          <para>DATA CORRECTION AND PROCESSING</para>
          <para>The absorbance data from the spectrophotometer were corrected for each sample by first subtracting the daily Nanopure blank from each sample scan. Absorbance values (A254) were converted to Naperian coefficients (a254) using  the equation: a254=2.303*A254/l, where l is the cuvette pathlength (0.01 m, Stedmon and Nelson 2015). The value of a254 and a350 at wavelengths 254 and 350, respectively, are reported. The natural log was taken for each Naperian coefficient from wavelengths 190 to 850 nm. The natural log values between wavelengths 275 nm to 295 nm were averaged (S275_295), as well as the natural log values between wavelengths 350 nm and 400 nm (S350_400). The slope ratio (SR) was calculated by dividing the two previously calculated averages, 275-295/350-400 (Helms et al. 2008). All instances where replicates were collected and analyzed are reported in this dataset. CSV files used to correct the absorbance data are published with this data product in the Corrected_CDOM_2019_2020 zipped folder. We note that absorbance data are not reported for samples from 2021 - 2023 in the 'OpticalData_2019_2025.csv' dataset: absorbance scans were run for these samples and used to correct fluorescence data, but these data were not extracted in the post processing script. In 2024-2025, absorbance data for a254 and a350 are reported but spectral slope metrics were not calculated. Raw CDOM data from 2021 - 2025 are provided in the CDOM_data_2021_2025.zip folder, see the ReadME file within this folder for further information on using these data.</para>
          <para>Fluorescence samples were blank-corrected using a Nanopure blank collected on the same day as analysis. Instrument excitation and emission corrections were applied to each blank-corrected sample in addition to corrections for inner-filtering effects using the absorbance scan collected on the same day of analysis, and calibrated against the Raman signal of Nanopure water using an in-house Matlab script. Emission scans for each sample were concatenated into 151 x 43 excitation-emission matrices (EEMs). Peaks B (Ex: 275, Em: 305), T (Ex: 275, Em: 340), A (Ex: 260, Em: 400-460), C (Ex: 320-360, Em: 420-460), M (Ex:290-310 , Em: 370-410), and N (Ex: 280, Em: 370) were identified based on existing literature (Coble, 2007; Fellman et al. 2010, and references within). The fluorescence index (FI) was calculated as the ratio between emission wavelengths measured at 450 nm and 500 nm at an excitation of 370 nm (McKnight et al. 2001). BIX was calculated as the ratio between the beta (380 nm, Peak M) and alpha (430 nm, Peak C) regions of fluorescence measured at an excitation wavelength of 310 nm (Huguet et al. 2009). HIX was calculated as the ratio of the H (435-480 nm) and L (300-345 nm) regions of fluorescence measured at an excitation wavelength of 254 nm (Huguet et al. 2009). Peak ratios (T_B, T_M, T_N, T_C, A_T, A_C, A_M, M_C, C_N) were calculated by dividing the respective peak intensities. Samples with dilution 1 or 2 are reported in this dataset. The Matlab script used to correct EEM data and calculate metrics is also included (EEMCorr_Fl.m).</para>
          <para>PARAFAC MODELING</para>
          <para>We note that PARAFAC modeling was only conducted for data from the sampling campaign in Beaverdam and Falling Creek Reservoirs from 2019 - 2020. We have included corrected EEM files for samples from the 2021 - 2025 sampling campaign in the EEMs_pfiles_2021_2025 zipped folder so this data could be used for future PARAFAC modeling work.</para>
          <para>Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) is a multiway, statistical decomposition technique that can be applied to a collection of EEMs to identify and track broad classes of fDOM, represented as linearly independent components having excitation and emission properties common to organic fluorophores. A PARAFAC model was fitted to a total of 250 samples collected from both reservoirs (Falling Creek Reservoir and Beaverdam Reservoir) at all stations and depths using the drEEM toolbox in Matlab (Murphy et al. 2013). EEMs were normalized to their total fluorescence prior to PARAFAC modeling. A 4-component PARAFAC model was fitted to the collected DOM samples. The model was split-half validated following Murphy et al. 2013. Samples were reverse-normalized and Fmax values for each component and sample were calculated by multiplying the maximum excitation loading and emission loading for each component by its model score (Murphy et al. 2013). Corrected EEMs files used in the PARAFAC model are included in the EEMs_pfiles_2019_2020 zipped folder associated with this data publication. The Matlab script used to fit the PARAFAC model is also included (PARAFAC_Mod.m).</para>
          <para>Identified components were compared to previously published PARAFAC spectra on OpenFluor (Murphy et al. 2014). Component 1 (C1) matched with 19 other spectra on OpenFluor and was identified as ubiquitous, terrestrial, humic-like Peaks A and C (DeFrancesco and Gueguen, 2021; Catalan et al. 2020; Derrien et al. 2020). Component 2 (C2) matched with 22 other spectra on OpenFluor and was identified as humic-like, fulvic-acid, peak C (Yamashita et al. 2011; Goncalves-Araujo et al. 2015; Murphy et al. 2008). Component 3 (C3) matched with 1 other spectra on OpenFluor and was identified as humic-like DOM (humic-like DOM). FInally, component 4 (C4) matched with 17 other spectra and was identified as protein-like DOM (Zhou et al. 2019; Dainard et al. 2015; Wauthy et al. 2018). The output from OpenFluor is included in the data publication.</para>
          <para>Data from 2019 - 2020 (absorbance, fluorescence, PARAFAC model results) were collated, QA/QC'd, and formatted for publication using the Abs_QA_QC_2019_2020.R script included in the publication. Data from 2021 - 2025 (absorbance and fluorescence) were collated, QA/QC'd, appended to the 2019-2020 data, and formatted for publication using the EEMs_publishing_QAQC_2019_2025.R script included in the publication.</para>
          <para>&#13;
