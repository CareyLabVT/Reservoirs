Contributions to the 2023 revision: Contributions to the 2023 revision: CCC developed and led the reservoir monitoring program 2013-present, and oversaw data collection for these samples throughout this time. KKH, ABP, and DWH co-led sample analysis and calculations. ABP led the field monitoring program, automated the datastream, and developed the QAQC script. ABP also developed new workflows for chlorophyll calculations based on methods from BRN. BRN developed the analysis method, and trained all co-authors on analytical chemistry instruments, analyses, and QAQC best practices. RK, MK, GH, and ET contributed substantially to fieldwork, filtering samples, and digitizing handwritten logs. KKH developed the visual inspection script and led data publishing for 2023.
