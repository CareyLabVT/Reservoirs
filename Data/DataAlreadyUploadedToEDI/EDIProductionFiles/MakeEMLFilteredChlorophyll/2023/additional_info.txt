"CCC developed and led the reservoir monitoring program 2013-present, and oversaw data collection during this time. KKH and ABP co-led sample analysis and data processing. ABP led field monitoring, automated the datastream, wrote the QAQC script, and developed new workflows for chlorophyll data processing based on methods from BRN. BRN developed the analysis method, and trained all co-authors on analytical chemistry instruments, analyses, and QAQC. RK, MK, GH, and ET contributed to fieldwork, labwork, and digitizing data. KKH developed the visual inspection script and led data publishing for 2023."
