CCC developed and led the reservoir monitoring program 2013-present, and oversaw data collection during this time. KKH and DWH co-led sample analysis and data processing. ABP led field monitoring, automated the datastream, wrote the QAQC script, and developed new workflows for chlorophyll data processing based on methods from BRN. SK, GH, and ET contributed to fieldwork, labwork, and digitizing data. KKH led data publishing for 2024.
