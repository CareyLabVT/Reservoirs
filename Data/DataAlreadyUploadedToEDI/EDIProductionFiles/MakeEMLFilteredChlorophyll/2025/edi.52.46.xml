    <abstract>
      <para>Water column chlorophyll a was analyzed from 2014 to 2025 in seven freshwater reservoirs in southwestern Virginia (VA), USA, and one freshwater lake in central New Hampshire (NH), USA. These waterbodies are: Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, VA), Carvins Cove Reservoir (Roanoke, VA), Claytor Lake (Pulaski, VA), Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, VA), Gatewood Reservoir (Pulaski, VA), Smith Mountain Lake (Bedford, VA), Spring Hollow Reservoir (Salem, VA), and Lake Sunapee (Sunapee, NH). Beaverdam, Carvins Cove, Falling Creek, and Spring Hollow Reservoirs are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority as primary or secondary drinking water sources for Roanoke, Virginia; Gatewood Reservoir is a drinking water source for the Town of Pulaski, Virginia; and Smith Mountain Lake is jointly treated by the Bedford Regional Water Authority and the Western Virginia Water Authority as a drinking water source for Franklin County, Virginia. Claytor Lake is managed for hydroelectric power generation by the Appalachian Power Company. Lake Sunapee is a glacially-formed lake known for its oligotrophic water quality. The dataset consists of depth profiles of chlorophyll a samples generally measured at the deepest site of each reservoir adjacent to the dam or at the buoy site of Lake Sunapee. The water column samples were collected approximately fortnightly from March-April and weekly from May-October from 2014 - present at Falling Creek Reservoir and Beaverdam Reservoir, approximately fortnightly from May-August in most years at Carvins Cove Reservoir, approximately fortnightly from May-August in Gatewood and Spring Hollow Reservoirs from 2014-2016, approximately fortnightly from May-August of 2014 in Smith Mountain Lake, sporadically from May-August of 2014 in Claytor Lake, and sporadically from June-August of 2021-2022 and 2024-2025 in Lake Sunapee. From 2018-2025, samples were collected primarily at a single depth in each reservoir, with sample collection at two depths in Falling Creek Reservoir in 2025. Additional chlorophyll a samples were collected at multiple upstream and inflow sites along tributaries to Beaverdam and Falling Creek Reservoirs in summer 2019. The water samples collected were analyzed for both phaeophytin (also known as pheophytin) and chlorophyll a to quantify and correct for degraded phytoplankton within the sample. A maintenance log and quality assurance/quality control analysis script accompanies the data.</para>

          <para>SAMPLING TIMES AND LOCATION</para>
          <para>Sampling occurred between the hours of 9:00 and 15:00 EST and are denoted in the DateTime column as 12:00 when not recorded. In 2014-2016, water column samples were collected approximately fortnightly from March-April and weekly from May-October at Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR) and Beaverdam Reservoir (BVR), approximately fortnightly from May-August at Carvins Cove Reservoir (CCR), and approximately fortnightly from May-August in Gatewood and Spring Hollow Reservoirs. In 2014, samples were also collected approximately fortnightly from May-August in Smith Mountain Lake and sporadically from May-August in Claytor Lake. In 2018-2025, routine monitoring focused on 1.6 m at BVR and FCR, with samples collected weekly from May-October and fortnightly - monthly from November-April. In 2025, an additional chlorophyll sample was collected at 0.1 m depth in FCR. In 2019, additional chlorophyll samples were collected at multiple upstream and inflow sites along tributaries to FCR and BVR. CCR (2017-2023) and Lake Sunapee (SNP, 2021-2022) were sampled sporadically in June-August. In 2024, additional chlorophyll a samples were collected at 8 sites ~monthly from May - December in CCR. In 2025, we collected surface samples from the site closest to the dam (Site 50) and one inflow stream (Site 101) fortnightly at CCR and monthly during the winter. Samples were also collected monthly from another inflow in CCR (Site 301). In 2024 and 2025, we collected samples ~twice a week from mid-June - August in SNP.</para>
          <para>SAMPLE COLLECTION AND EQUIPMENT</para>
          <para>Unfiltered water samples for chlorophyll were most commonly collected at 0.1m and 1.6m. Additionally, unfiltered water samples were collected at the following depths for each reservoir or lake: 0.1, 1.5, 1.6, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 6.5, 6.8, 7, 7.5, 9, and 12 meters within Beaverdam Reservoir, which has a maximum depth (Zmax) of 13 meters at full pond; 0.1, 5, 6, 12, 14, 18, 19, 20, and 21 meters within Carvins Cove Reservoir, which has a Zmax of 21.3 meters at full pond; 0.1, 5, 6, 7, 30, and 34 meters within Claytor Lake Reservoir, which has a Zmax of 35 meters; 0.1, 1, 1.6, 2, 2.8, 3.8, 4, 4.1, 4.5, 5, 6, 6.2, 7, and 9 meters within Falling Creek Reservoir, which has a Zmax of 9.3 meters at full pond; 0.1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 13.5 and 14 meters within Gatewood Reservoir, which has a Zmax of 14 meters;  0.1, 6, 7, 8, 25, 28 and 30 meters within Smith Mountain Lake Reservoir, which has a Zmax of ~61 meters; 0.1, 5, 7, 8, 14, 25, 28 and 31 meters within Spring Hollow Reservoir, which has a Zmax of &gt;60 meters; and 0.1, 1, and 9 meters within Lake Sunapee, which has a Zmax of 33 meters. In 2024 and 2025 at Lake Sunapee, chlorophyll samples were collected at 0.1 meters and the depth of the chlorophyll maximum, as determined by a handheld sensor. A 4-L Van Dorn water sampler was used to collect samples (Wildco, Yulee, Florida, USA) which were stored in opaque 2-L high-density polyethylene bottles. Samples were refrigerated and filtered within 48 hours of collection with GF/C filters and filters were immediately frozen after filtration. Samples were generally analyzed within 4 months of collection date.</para>
          <para>CHEMICAL ANALYSES AND EQUIPMENT</para>
          <para>Samples were extracted using a 96% ethanol solution at room temperature for 3-24 hours (Wasmund et al. 2006) and then analyzed by spectrophotometric analysis. To quantify the concentration of phaeophytin (also known as pheophytin) within the sample, the analysis adopts the acidification recommendation of Parker et al. (2016), in which 240 microliters of 0.1 N HCl was added to the sample. The sample was homogenized and left to sit for 90 seconds for samples analyzed through 2018, or 120 seconds for samples analyzed after 2019. Samples were quantified using the monochromatic spectrophotometric method for chlorophyll a after correction for the presence of phaeopigments, to provide a metric of "live" phytoplankton at the time of collection (Lorenzen 1967). The phaeophytin concentration (a metric of "dead" but still fluorescing phytoplankton) is also reported. In 2014, total chlorophyll a was corrected for phaeophytin but values for phaeophytin were lost during digitization. </para>
          <para>Samples were deemed below detection if the pigment in extract was less than 34ug/L (Salinas 1988). This corresponds to a detection limit of ~0.2ug/L chlorophyll in water, assuming an initial filtered volume of 1000mL. Because samples contained in this dataset have varied initial filter volumes, we use a cutoff of 34ug/L in extract to determine detection limit. Samples below this threshold are flagged with a value of 4.</para>
          <para>Both extraction and analysis were performed in the absence of direct light to prevent the degradation of chlorophyll a. Samples collected were not always analyzed, leading to occasional incomplete water column profiles for certain dates within the dataset.</para>
          <para>DUPLICATES</para>
          <para>Duplicates are averaged prior to 2022, and averaged duplicates are flagged with a 5. Starting in 2023, duplicate samples are retained in the data. A "Rep" column was added to the data in 2025, and duplicate samples are assigned a "2" in the Rep column. For most duplicates, duplicate samples were filtered from the same 2L water sample collected from the field. Duplicates from Lake Sunapee are generally field duplicates, so two separate water samples were collected from the same depth and then filtered. </para>
          <para>FLAGGED DATA</para>
          <para>Data are flagged in the maintenance log, and flags are applied to the data using the QAQC script. Starting in 2023, all phaeophytin values that were below zero were set to zero throughout the dataset. Prior to 2022, duplicated field and method replicate values were not flagged. In 2022, duplicate values were averaged and flagged with 5. Starting in 2023, duplicate values were retained in the data. Flags with multiple numbers are a combination of multiple flags (e.g., if the values were averaged and the pigment in the extract of the averaged sample was below detection then these columns were flagged as 45, for a flag of 4 for pigment below detection and a flag of 5 for averaged duplicate value.) For both chlorophyll and phaeophytin: 0 = Value acceptable. No flag; 1 = Sample absorbance at 664nm before acid addition was &lt;0.030, sample may be below detection; 2 = Sample not taken; 3 = Duplicate check failed; 4 = Pigment in extract below detection (&lt;34 ug/L in extract); 5 = Duplicate values were averaged. 6 = The ratio of the concentration before acid addition to the concentration after acid addition was greater than 1.72. 7 = Sample turbidity (absorbance at 750 nm) was higher than 0.005. Sample should be used with caution. 99 = A sample name was entered incorrectly and was changed.   </para>
