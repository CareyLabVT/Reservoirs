CCC developed and led the reservoir monitoring program 2013-present, and oversaw the collection and analysis of this dataset throughout this time. JHW is the point person for chlorophyll-a data collation and laboratory analysis, QAQC and publishing from 2019 - 2021. ABP led field collection in 2020 and 2021. WMW helped coordinate and supervise chlorophyll-a analysis and processing from 2019-2021. AD and CEB led field prep and post-processing in 2021. MEL was the point person for chl data collection, analysis, and QAQC from 2016â€“2018. KDH was the point person for chl data collection, analysis, QAQC and publishing from 2014-2015, and JPD was the point person for data collection, analysis, QAQC and publishing for 2013-2014. BRN developed analysis methods, led chemical analyses during COVID 19 (2020-2021), and trained all co-authors on analytical chemistry instruments, analyses, and QAQC best practices.

From 2014 to 2019, multiple whole-ecosystem manipulations were conducted at Falling Creek Reservoir. These manipulations include intermittent operation of hypolimnetic oxygenation and pulsed epilimnetic mixing engineering systems. For a detailed description of the hypolimnetic oxygenation engineered system, see Gerling et al. (2014) and for a detailed description of the epilimnetic mixing engineered system, see Chen et al. (2017). These systems were operated over time from 2014-2018 following Table 1 in Gerling et al. (2016), Table 1 in Munger et al. (2016), and Table 2 in McClure et al. (2018). In 2019, hypolimnetic oxygenation was conducted from June 3-June 17, July 8-July 22, August 5-August 19 and September 2-November 20.
