From 2014 to 2019, multiple whole-ecosystem manipulations were conducted at Falling Creek Reservoir. These manipulations include intermittent operation of hypolimnetic oxygenation and pulsed epilimnetic mixing engineering systems. For a detailed description of the hypolimnetic oxygenation engineered system, see Gerling et al. (2014) and for a detailed description of the epilimnetic mixing engineered system, see Chen et al. (2017). These systems were operated over time from 2014-2018 following Table 1 in Gerling et al. (2016), Table 1 in Munger et al. (2016), and Table 2 in McClure et al. (2018). In 2019, hypolimnetic oxygenation was conducted from June 3-June 17, July 8-July 22, August 5-August 19 and September 2-November 20.
