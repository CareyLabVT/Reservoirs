Contributions to the 2022 revision: CCC developed and led the reservoir monitoring program 2013-present, and oversaw data collection for these samples throughout this time. ABP led the field monitoring program, the data QAQC, and publishing for 2022. WMW, ABP, and DWH co-led sample analysis and calculations. BRN developed the analysis method, and trained all co-authors on analytical chemistry instruments, analyses, and QAQC best practices. BDG, ARD, and GH contributed substantially to preparation, sampling for field campaigns, filtering sampling, and digitizing handwritten logs.  

Acknowledgments and historical contributions: This data package has been iteratively updated over time and builds on the many historical contributions of co-authors listed in previous revisions. We thank the Western Virginia Water Authority for providing access to these sites, the Reservoir Group for contributing to fieldwork.
