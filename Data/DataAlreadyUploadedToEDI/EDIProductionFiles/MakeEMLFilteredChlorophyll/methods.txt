SAMPLING TIMES
Sampling occurred between the hours of 9:00 and 15:00 EST and are denoted in the DateTime column as 12:00. 

SAMPLE COLLECTION AND EQUIPMENT
Chlorophyll a 
unfiltered water samples were collected at the following depths for each reservoir: 0.1, 5, 6, 12, 14, 18, 19, 20, and 21 meters within Carvins Cove Reservoir, which has a Zmax of 21.3 meters at full pond; 0.1, 5, 6, 7, 30, and 34 meters within Claytor Lake; 0.1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 13.5 and 14 meters within Gatewood Reservoir, which has a Zmax of 14 meters; 0.1, 5, 7, 8, 14, 25, 28 and 31 meters within Spring Hollow Reservoir, which has a Zmax of >60 m; 0.1, 6, 7, 8, 25, 28 and 30 meters within Smith Mountain Lake; 0.1, 1.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 6.5, 6.8, 7, 7.5, 9, and 12 meters within Beaverdam Reservoir, which has a Zmax of 13 meters at full pond; and 0.1, 1, 1.6, 2, 2.8, 3.8, 4, 4.1, 4.5, 5, 6, 6.2, 7, and 9 meters within Falling Creek Reservoir, which has a Zmax of 9.3 meters at full pond. A 4-L Van Dorn water sampler was used to collect samples (Wildco, Yulee, Florida, USA) which were stored in opaque 2-L high-density polyethylene bottles. Samples were refrigerated and filtered within 48 hours of collection with GF/C filters and filters were immediately frozen after filtration. Samples were generally analyzed within 4 months of collection date. 

CHEMICAL ANALYSES AND EQUIPMENT
Chlorophyll a 
samples were extracted using a 96% ethanol solution at room temperature for 3-24 hours (Wasmund et al. 2006) and then analyzed by spectrophotometric analysis. To quantify the concentration of pheophytin within the sample, the analysis adopts the acidification recommendation of Parker et al. (2016), in which 240 microliters of 0.1 N HCL was added to the sample. The sample was homogenized and left to sit for 90 seconds for samples analyzed through 2018, or 120 seconds for samples analyzed after 2019. The quantitation of the sample used was the monochromatic spectrophotometric method for chlorophyll a after correction for the presence of pheopigments, to provide a metric of "live" phytoplankton at the time of collection (Lorenzen 1967). The pheophytin concentration (a metric of "dead" but still fluorescing phytoplankton) is also reported. In 2014, total chlorophyll a was corrected for pheophytin but pheophytin values were not recorded. Both extraction and analysis were performed in the absence of direct light to prevent the degradation of chlorophyll a. Samples collected were not always analyzed, leading to occasional incomplete water column profiles for certain dates within the dataset.
