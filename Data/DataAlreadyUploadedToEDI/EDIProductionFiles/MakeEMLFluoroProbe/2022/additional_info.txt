ADDITIONAL NOTES
From 2013 to 2019, multiple whole-ecosystem manipulations were conducted at Falling Creek Reservoir. These manipulations include intermittent operation of hypolimnetic oxygenation (HOx) and pulsed epilimnetic mixing (EM) engineering systems. For a detailed description of the hypolimnetic oxygenation engineered system, see Gerling et al. (2014) and for a detailed description of the epilimnetic mixing engineered system, see Chen et al. (2017). These systems were operated over time following Table 1 in Gerling et al. (2016), Table 1 in Munger et al. (2016), Table 2 in McClure et al. (2018), and Table SI.1 in Hounshell et al. (2020). Additional hypolimnetic oxygenation and epilimnetic mixing events not currently detailed in peer-reviewed articles are listed below:

2017
EM was activated on 29 May and from 10-12 July.

2019
HOx was activated during the following time periods: 03 June to 17 June, 08 July to 22 July, 05 August to 19 August, 02 September to 20 November.

2020
HOx was activated during the following time periods: 29 June to 11 September, 25 September to 02 December.

2021
HOx was activated on 11 June but malfunctioned. It was fixed 14 September and operated from 14 September to 06 December.
