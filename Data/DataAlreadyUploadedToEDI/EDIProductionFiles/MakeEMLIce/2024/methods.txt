Overview
We measured ice cover at Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR) beginning in the winter of 2013-2014 and Beaverdam Reservoir (BVR) beginning in the winter of 2020-2021. We defined ice cover as the presence of ice (any thickness) covering more than 50% of the East-West diameter of the deep hole of FCR or BVR, as could be ascertained by a visual observer standing at the catwalk at the center point of the dam of the reservoir looking in the North direction (FCR) or at the boat launch looking in the North direction (BVR). This ice cover metric should only be applied for the deep hole of the two reservoirs because it may not be always representative of ice cover on the shallow upstream arm of the reservoirs. However, we can confirm from hiking around FCR on four sampling days with complete ice cover at the deep hole during the monitoring period that the ice coverage at the deep hole was the same as upstream and throughout the reservoir as a whole. 

Methods
For FCR, we received daily ice observations from Western Virginia Water Authority (WVWA) reservoir water treatment operators on site during most of 2013-2016. After winter 2016, reservoir water treatment operators were not consistently at FCR and thus visual observations from WVWA staff became sporadic at that reservoir; we have no visual observations for ice cover at BVR due to the logistical challenges of accessing that reservoir during winter. Thus, starting in winter 2018 for FCR and winter 2020 for BVR, we used an alternative method to determine ice presence on the reservoirs in lieu of visual observations. 

Our new method involves using automated hourly water temperature data from thermistors deployed at multiple depths in FCR from 2018-2024 (Carey et al. XXXX) and thermistors in BVR from 2020-2024 (Carey et al. XXXX) as well as HOBO temperature loggers deployed at 1-m depth resolution at the same BVR deep hole site in 2016-2018 (Carey et al. 2023a) to check for near-zero temperatures at the surface of the water column and inverse thermal stratification, which signified the presence of ice. Following Wetzel (2001), inverse stratification is easily disrupted by a small amount of wind, so if inverse stratification occurred amidst measurable wind at the reservoir (see Carey et al. XXXX for wind data), then we classified that period as having ice cover. Thermal stratification was calculated on the hourly timescale and ice cover was determined by the presence or absence of inverse thermal stratification for any single hour during a given day (defined as a greater than 0.1 degree difference between the surface and bottom of the reservoir). During the winters of 2017-2024, there were occasional visual observations from members of the Carey Lab at Virginia Tech on FCR sampling days or WVWA staff. These visual observations were recorded and used to validate our temperature-derived ice presence calculations. While these methods are not perfect, they represented the most robust way possible to maintain a daily ice cover record over time given the data available.

We provide two separate data products describing ice cover. The first data product ("ice_transition_binary.csv") includes only days when there was an ice transition (ice on or ice off) as indicated by visual observation or the inverse stratification method. Because the inverse stratification method was calculated from 10-minute resolution sensors, we provide the time of that ice transition for FCR starting in 2018 and BVR in 2020. Prior to those years, all transition times were set to 12:00 in lieu of time data. The second data product ("ice_daily_binary.csv") includes all days of the year with a binary value (0 or 1) to indicate ice presence for a reservoir using either the visual observation or inverse stratification methods.
