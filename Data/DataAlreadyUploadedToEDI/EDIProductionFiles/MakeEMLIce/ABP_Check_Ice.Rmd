#### Checking the difference between the top and the bottom

```{r Compare 1m and 8m, echo=FALSE}

FCR_Catwalk_EDI_2018_2023%>%
  filter(DateTime>ymd_hms("2022-12-20 00:00:00") & DateTime<ymd_hms("2023-02-10 00:00:00"))%>%

  geom_hline(yintercept=-0.1, linetype="dashed", color = "red")+
  scale_x_datetime(date_breaks = "8 day", date_minor_breaks = "1 day")+
  theme_bw()

```

Checking the Winter timeseries for when the difference between the top and the bottom is greater than -0.1. 
The red line "inverse" is the 1m thermistor minus the 9m thermistor while "inverse 2" is the surface thermistor minus the 9m thermistor. The red dotted line is at -0.1 because the accuracy of the thermistors is 0.075.

After looking at the the timeseries let's break it down for each period and look more closely at the temperature profiles, disolved oxygen profiles, and images from the camera at the catwalk. 

#### When was the first day of Ice on in December

```{r Dec}

profile_plot(DATA=FCR_Catwalk_EDI_2018_2023,
           start_time = "2022-12-22 00:00:00",
           end_time = "2023-01-05 00:00:00",
           Varibles = starts_with("Thermis"))
# DO
profile_plot(DATA=FCR_Catwalk_EDI_2018_2023,
           start_time = "2022-12-22 00:00:00",
           end_time = "2023-01-05 00:00:00",
           Varibles = c("RDOsat_percent_5", "RDOsat_percent_9", "EXODOsat_percent_1"))

```

Pretty clear inverse stratification from about Dec. 23 to January 2nd. 

It looks like we see ice on the camera on Dec. 25th

#### When did ice come off at the beginning of January 2023

```{r}
profile_plot(DATA=FCR_Catwalk_EDI_2018_2023,
           start_time = "2022-12-31 00:00:00",
           end_time = "2023-01-05 00:00:00",
           Varibles = starts_with("Thermis"))
# DO
profile_plot(DATA=FCR_Catwalk_EDI_2018_2023,
           start_time = "2022-12-22 00:00:00",
           end_time = "2023-01-05 00:00:00",
           Varibles = c("RDOsat_percent_5", "RDOsat_percent_9", "EXODOsat_percent_1"))

```

It looks like there is no longer inverse stratification on some time on January 2nd. Let's look at the pictures

#### Checking the difference between the top and the bottom

```{r Compare surface and bottom}

BVR_platform_data_2020_2023%>%
  filter(DateTime>ymd_hms("2022-12-20 00:00:00") & DateTime<ymd_hms("2023-02-10 00:00:00"))%>%

  pivot_longer(!DateTime, names_to = "name", values_to = "obs")%>%
  ggplot(., aes(DateTime, obs, col=name))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_hline(yintercept=-0.1, linetype="dashed", color = "red")+
  scale_x_datetime(date_breaks = "5 day", date_minor_breaks = "1 day")+
  theme_bw()

```

Checking the Winter timeseries for when the difference between the top and the bottom is greater than -0.1. 
The red line "inverse" is the thermistor closest to the surface minus the bottom thermistor while "inverse 2" is the second highest thermistor minus the bottom one. The red dotted line is at -0.1 because the accuracy of the thermistors is 0.075.

After looking at the the timeseries let's break it down for each period and look more closely at the temperature profiles, disolved oxygen profiles, and images from the camera at the catwalk.
