I defined ice cover as the presence of ice (any thickness) covering more than 50% of the East-West diameter of the deep hole of Falling Creek Reservoir, as could be ascertained by a visual observer standing at the catwalk at the center point of the dam of the reservoir looking in the North direction. This ice cover metric should only be applied for the deep hole of the reservoir because it may not be always representative of ice cover on the shallow upstream arm of the reservoir. However, I can confirm from hiking around the reservoir on two sampling days with complete ice cover at the deep hole that the ice coverage at the deep hole was the same as upstream and throughout the reservoir as a whole. 

I received daily ice observations from reservoir water treatment operators who worked at the reservoir for most of 2013-2016; after winter 2016, water treatment at the reservoir was sporadic. Occasionally there were visual observations from members of the Carey Lab at Virginia Tech on reservoir sampling days or WVWA staff. If those data were not available, I used two alternate methods to determine ice cover. First, I used water temperature data from sensors deployed at multiple depths in the reservoir (Carey et al. 2019b) as well as HOBO temperature loggers deployed at 1-m depth resolution at the same deep hole site in 2016-2018 to check for near-zero temperatures at the surface of the water column and inverse thermal stratification, which signified the presence of ice. Second, the water temperature data were verified by looking at data from a research-grade meteorological station deployed on the reservoir dam. The meteorological station had an upwelling shortwave radiation sensor deployed on the catwalk over the reservoir (see Carey et al. 2019a). During periods of ice cover, the upwelling radiation exhibited substantially higher radiation values because of the reflection of light off the ice during daylight hours, which was used to identify days of ice cover at the deep hole was present. While these methods are not perfect, they represented the most robust way possible to maintain a daily ice cover record over time given the data available.
