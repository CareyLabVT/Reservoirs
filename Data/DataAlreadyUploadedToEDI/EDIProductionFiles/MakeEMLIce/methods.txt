I defined ice cover as the presence of ice (any thickness) covering more than 50% of the East-West diameter of the deep hole of Falling Creek Reservoir, as could be ascertained by a visual observer standing at the catwalk at the center point of the dam of the reservoir looking in the North direction. This ice cover metric should only be applied for the deep hole of the reservoir because it may not be always representative of ice cover on the shallow upstream arm of the reservoir. However, I can confirm from hiking around the reservoir on three sampling days with complete ice cover at the deep hole during the monitoring period that the ice coverage at the deep hole was the same as upstream and throughout the reservoir as a whole. 

I received daily ice observations from reservoir water treatment operators who worked at the reservoir for most of 2013-2016; after winter 2016, water treatment at the reservoir was sporadic. Occasionally there were visual observations from members of the Carey Lab at Virginia Tech on reservoir sampling days or WVWA staff. If those data were not available, I used three alternate methods to determine ice cover. First, I used water temperature data from thermistors deployed at multiple depths in the reservoir from 2018-2021 (Carey et al. 2021b) as well as HOBO temperature loggers deployed at 1-m depth resolution at the same deep hole site in 2016-2018 to check for near-zero temperatures at the surface of the water column and inverse thermal stratification, which signified the presence of ice. Following Wetzel (2001), inverse stratification is easily disrupted by a small amount of wind, so if inverse stratification occurred amidst measurable wind at the reservoir (see Carey et al. 2021a for wind data), then I classified that period as having ice cover.

Second, the water temperature data were verified by looking at data from a research-grade meteorological station deployed on the reservoir dam. The meteorological station had an upwelling shortwave radiation sensor deployed on the catwalk over the reservoir (see Carey et al. 2021a). During periods of ice cover, the upwelling radiation exhibited higher radiation values because of the reflection of light off the ice during daylight hours, which was used to identify days of ice cover at the deep hole was present. I also referred to the albedo data (upwelling shortwave radiation/downwelling shortwave radiation) as a check on cloudy days (Carey et al. 2021a).

Third, the water temperature data were also verified by looking at dissolved oxygen concentrations measured by sensors deployed at the deep hole at 1 m, 5 m, and 9 m depths. During periods with more than 1 day of ice cover, dissolved oxygen depletion at 9 m was noticeable, which indicated inverse stratification. 

While these methods are not perfect, they represented the most robust way possible to maintain a daily ice cover record over time given the data available. Data flags are conservative and indicate ice periods without visual observations and additional dissolved oxygen data for triple verification.
