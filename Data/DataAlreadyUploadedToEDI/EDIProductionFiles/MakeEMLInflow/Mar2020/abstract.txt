Discharge rates and water temperature of the primary inflow tributary into Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA) were measured at a gauged weir on a 15-minute temporal resolution from 2013 to 2020. Falling Creek Reservoir is a drinking water supply reservoir owned and managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority (WVWA). The dataset consists of water temperatures and discharge rates calculated from a pressure transducer deployed by the WVWA in a rectangular weir (15 May 2013 - 6 June 2019) and in a v-notched weir (7 June 2019 - 09 March 2020) at the same site. From 22 April 2019 to 09 March 2020, water temperature and discharge data were also collected from a Virginia Tech-deployed (VT) pressure transducer installed in the same weir(s).
