We calculated the daily discharge rate of water in cubic meters per second entering Falling Creek Reservoir through the gauged weir on its primary inflow. Inflow was calculated from pressure sensors installed by the Western Virginia Water Authority (WVWA) from 2013 to present and using pressure sensors installed by Virginia Tech (VT) researchers (PI Cayelan Carey) from 22 April 2019 to present.

We measured the amount of water entering into the reservoir through the weir with an INW Aquistar PT2X pressure sensor (INW, Kirkland, Washington, USA) installed by the WVWA, which recorded the weir water level with a pressure sensor and stream temperature every 15 minutes. From 22 April 2019 to present, we also measured pressure and stream temperature every 15 minutes using a pressure sensor installed by VT. From 15 May 2013 - 6 June 2019 a rectangular weir was installed; from 7 June 2019 to present, a v-notch weir was installed. The water level data were used to calculate the daily flow rate of water entering into the reservoir, following Gerling et al. (2014) for the rectangular weir (15 May 2013 - 6 June 2019) and the equation below for the v-notch weir (7 June 2019 - present):

V-notch weir, discharge equation:
Q = 2.391 x H^2.5

Where Q is the calculated discharge (m^3 s^-1), 2.391 is the conversion factor for a 120 degree angle -notch weir in m^3 s^-1, and H is the head on the weir (m).

For the 15 May 2013 - 6 June 2019 time period, the weir installed at the inflow was rectangular, and thus very low flows were often not well-resolved by our flow equation. At these times, flow is reported as NA. However, the Falling Creek Reservoir inflow stream generally does have perennial flow.
