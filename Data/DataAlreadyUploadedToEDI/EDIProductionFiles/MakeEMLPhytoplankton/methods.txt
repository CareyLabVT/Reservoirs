FIELD SAMPING OF PHYTOPLANKTON
Phytoplankton depth samples were collected at the deepest site (9.3 m) in Falling Creek Reservoir using a 4-L van Dorn sampler (Wildco, Yulee, FL, USA) at the depth of chlorophyll maximum (Cmax) weekly from May-September and periodically (ranging from weekly to monthly) at other times of year during 2016-2019. Cmax depth was determined using a submersible fluorescence-based profiler (FluoroProbe; bbe moldaenke, Schwentinental, Germany; Carey et al. 2019), and depth samples were subsequently collected as close as possible to the depth of Cmax. The sampling depth was within  0.5 m of the Cmax each day, given the constraint of estimating Cmax depth from fluorescence profiles downloaded in the field. During the entire monitoring period, these depths ranged from 0.1-7 m, with a median of 3.8 m. Samples were immediately preserved in 250 mL amber high-density polyethylene bottles by adding approximately 1% Lugol's iodine by volume to each sample.
MICROSCOPE IDENTIFICATION OF PHYTOPLANKTON 
Before counting, three sub-samples of 20 mL from each phytoplankton sample were filtered onto 0.45 um GN-6 Metricel MCE membrane disc filters (Pall Corporation, New York, NY, USA) and fixed on permanent slides using 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA) following Crumpton (1987). Samples were subsequently enumerated on a Nikon Eclipse Ci microscope (Nikon, Minato City, Tokyo, Japan) at 400_ until at least 300 natural units (either single cells or colonies) or 10 fields of view had been counted, with counting effort evenly divided amongst the three sub-samples. Phytoplankton with a greatest axial linear dimension (GALD) of at least 5 um were identified to genus; smaller phytoplankton were identified to the highest possible taxonomic level. The first ten natural units of each genus were measured and used to calculate biovolume via approximation to known geometric shapes following Hillebrand et al. (1999). For samples with low abundance (less than 5) of large taxa (GALD greater than 100 um), an additional 20 fields were scanned at 200x for enumeration of large, rare taxa following Acker (2002). All microscopic identification and counts were conducted by the same taxonomist (M.E.L.)
