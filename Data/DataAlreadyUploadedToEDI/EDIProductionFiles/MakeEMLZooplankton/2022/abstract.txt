Crustacean and rotifer density and biomass were measured from 2014 to 2022 in five drinking water reservoirs in southwestern Virginia, USA. These reservoirs are: Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia), Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia), Carvins Cove Reservoir (Roanoke, Virginia), Gatewood Reservoir (Pulaski, Virginia), and Spring Hollow Reservoir (Salem, Virginia). Beaverdam, Falling Creek, Carvins Cove and Spring Hollow Reservoirs are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority as primary or secondary drinking water sources for Roanoke, Virginia, and Gatewood Reservoir is a drinking water source for the Town of Pulaski, Virginia. The dataset consists of both integrated vertical tow samples from the whole water column, just the epilimnion, and just the hypolimnion (as the difference between the full water column and epilimnion tows), as well as discrete depth measurements collected with a Schindler trap. Most samples were collected at the deepest site of each reservoir adjacent to the dam. The samples were collected approximately fortnightly in the spring, summer, and autumn months and there are also data from 24-hour sampling campaigns. During the 24-hour sampling campaigns conducted from 2019-2022, samples were collected from both deep and shallow sites.
