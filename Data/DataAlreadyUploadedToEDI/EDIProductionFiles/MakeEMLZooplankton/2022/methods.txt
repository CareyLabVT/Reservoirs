"Below, we divide the sampling methods by years, as sampling and microscopy in 2014-2016 was led by J.P.D. and in 2019-2022 by H.L.W., with slightly varying techniques used between the two periods."

2014-2016

"Zooplankton collection: Crustacean zooplankton and rotifers were collected at the deepest location in each reservoir, close to the dam. Zooplankton were collected by 74-micron mesh vertical tow nets (Wildlife Supply Company, Yulee, Florida, USA) approximately fortnightly during the thermally stratified period in 2014-2016 in BVR, CCR, and GWR, and 2014-2015 in SHR. In 2014 and 2015 in BVR, CCR, and GWR, tow nets were lowered to approximately 0.5 m above the bottom lake sediments and pulled up to the surface at a constant speed to collect zooplankton from the full water column. In SHR, zooplankton were only collected from 25-30 m deep to the surface to avoid substantial net catch efficiency issues. In 2016, in addition to the full water column tows in BVR, CCR, and GWR, a second vertical tow was also taken from either 1) the thermocline depth to the nearest meter determined from profiles collected at the same time, or the oxycline depth rounded to the nearest meter determined using a Conductivity, Temperature and Depth (CTD) profiler from SeaBird Electronics (SBE, Bellevue Washington, USA) or an YSI EXO2 sonde (YSI Incorporated, Yellow Springs, OH, USA). The second tow was collected in 2016 in these reservoirs to determine zooplankton present in the epilimnion vs. the hypolimnion when the reservoirs were fully oxic, or in the oxic vs. hypoxic parts of the water column in reservoirs experiencing hypolimnetic hypoxia."

"24-hour sampling campaigns: In 2016, we also performed 24-hour sampling campaigns to examine the effects of hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations on zooplankton diel vertical migration. Therefore, in addition to vertical tow samples, we also collected 30-L Schindler trap samples. Schindler traps (Wildlife Supply Company, Yulee, Florida, USA) were collected during these sampling events (as well as vertical tows) at noon, dusk, midnight, 2AM, dawn, and noon the following day. The 24-hour sampling campaigns were conducted on 7-8 June and 3-4 August in BVR, 27-28 May and 12-13 August in CCR, and 29-30 April, 26-27 June, and 4-5 September in GWR. Schindler trap samples were collected at each meter in the water column from 0.1 m to a meter just below the thermocline or the oxycline. On the second BVR 24-hour sampling event, we sampled each meter in the water column with the Schindler trap. Zooplankton samples for both vertical net tow and Schindler traps were preserved in ~70 percent ethanol."

"Zooplankton enumeration: Zooplankton were identified using a Meiji RZ dissecting microscope (Meiji Techno, San Jose, California, USA) at 50x magnification. Because of the large quantity of samples collected, crustacean zooplankton and rotifers were identified predominantly to the genus level. Daphnia were identified to the species level and cyclopoids were identified to the order level. At least 100 crustacean zooplankton and 100 rotifers were counted for each sample, or until three aliquots from each sample were counted. Densities were calculated by scaling counts per subsample to the volume of the vertical net tows from the water column or from the Schindler traps (Downing and Rigler, 1984). All large crustacean zooplankton (Leptodora sp. and Chaoborus sp.) were counted for all samples and then scaled to the volume of the vertical tow net or the volume of the Schindler trap. The first ten individual crustacean zooplankton taxa in each sample were measured and biomass was calculated using published length-weight regressions (Dumont and Balvay, 1979; Downing and Rigler, 1984). Biomass was not calculated for rotifers. If a taxon is not listed for a reservoir on a sampling date, that means that the density, and therefore its biomass, was zero. Chaoborus and Leptodora spp. were largely only counted for density, not biomass, estimates in 2014 and 2015."

"Biomass calculations: Length-weight regression estimates used to calculate biomass, using ln(a) is the y-intercept and b is the slope. Estimates are summarized in Downing and Rigler (1984). Bosmina: ln(a)=2.7116, b=2.5294; Ceriodaphnia: ln(a)=2.5623, b = 3.3380; Chydorus: ln(a) = 4.543, b = 3.636; Daphnia: ln(a) = 1.54, b = 2.29; Diaphanosoma: ln(a) = 1.2894, b = 3.039; Cyclopoids: ln(a) = 2.2266, b = 3.230; Diaptomus: ln(a) = 1.05, b = 2.46; Leptodora: ln(a) = -0.8220, b = 2.670; Chaoborus: ln(a) = -2.183, b = 3.2345."

2019-2022

"Zooplankton collection: Crustacean zooplankton and rotifers were collected in Beaverdam Reservoir and Falling Creek Reservoir at their deepest locations close to the dam approximately fortnightly during the thermally stratified period in 2019-2022. Sampling occurred using 80-micron mesh vertical tow nets (Wildlife Supply Company, Yulee, Florida, USA). Vertical tows were lowered to approximately 0.5 m above the lake bottom sediments and pulled up to the surface at a constant speed to collect zooplankton from the full water column. After collection, samples were preserved in ~70 percent ethanol and brought back to the lab for enumeration."

"24-hour sampling campaigns: We conducted five 24-hour sampling campaigns during the summers of 2019-2022 in Beaverdam Reservoir. During each sampling campaign, we collected full water column tows using a zooplankton net at a deep and shallow site at noon, sunset, midnight, sunrise, and noon the following day. Sunrise and sunset sampling occurred over a period of four hours each day (2 hours before sunrise/sunset and one hour after sunrise/sunset). At the pelagic site, we collected full water column tows and oxycline tows that started at the depth where dissolved oxygen concentrations were just above 2 mg/L to identify differences in community structure in the epilimnion vs. hypolimnion. Additionally, at noon and midnight, we also collected 30-L Schindler trap samples (Wildlife Supply Company, Yulee, Florida, USA) at the deep site. The 24-hour sampling campaigns were conducted on 10-11 July 2019, 24-25 July 2019, 12-13 August 2020, 15-16 June 2021, and 7-8 July 2021. Schindler trap samples were collected at each meter in the water column from 0.1 m to 10m depth. Zooplankton samples for both vertical net tow and Schindler traps were preserved in ~70 percent ethanol in the field."

"Zooplankton enumeration: Zooplankton were identified using a Meiji RZ dissecting microscope (Meiji Techno, San Jose, California, USA). Total magnification was calculated by multiplying the objective magnification (ranging from 25-75X) by the ocular magnification (10X). Crustacean zooplankton and rotifers were identified to genus, except for copepods that were identified to order. A minimum of three aliquots were counted to obtain at least 100 total zooplankton, including both crustaceans and rotifers, per sample. Densities were calculated by scaling counts per subsample to the volume of the vertical net tows from the water column or from the Schindler traps (Downing and Rigler, 1984). We calculated net efficiency for each reservoir to scale the density and biomass values and correct for net clogging. Approximately 10-20 individual crustacean and rotifer zooplankton taxa were measured in each sample and biomass was calculated using published length-weight regressions (Dumont and Balvay, 1979; Downing and Rigler, 1984). If the taxon is not listed for a reservoir on a sampling date, that means that the density, and therefore, its biomass, was 0."
