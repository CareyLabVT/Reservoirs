We monitored water quality in Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA) with high-frequency (10-minute) sensors in 2020-2021. Beaverdam Reservoir is owned and managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority as a secondary drinking water source for Roanoke, Virginia. Depth profiles of water temperature were measured on ~1-meter intervals from the surface of the reservoir to 0.5 m above the sediments. Dissolved oxygen was monitored at 1.5 m, in the mid-water column at 2.37-4.65 m depth, and bottom waters at 0.5 m above the sediments, which corresponded to 9.7-11.98 m depth. A YSI EXO2 sonde measured temperature, conductivity, specific conductance, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, fluorescent dissolved organic matter, and turbidity at ~1.5 m depth. Due to variable water levels in the reservoir, the position of some sensors are held stationary to the sediments and presented as positions (thermistor temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pressure sensor), whereas the EXO2 sonde variables (temperature, dissolved oxygen, pressure, conductivity, specific conductance, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, total dissolved solids, fluorescent dissolved organic matter, and turbidity) were deployed on a buoy to move with the changing water level and remain at 1.5 m depth from the waterâ€™s surface. All variables were measured at the deepest site of the reservoir adjacent to the dam.
