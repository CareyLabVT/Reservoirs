Depth profiles of multiple water quality variables were collected at the deep hole of Beaverdam Reservoir in 2020-2021 using water temperature thermistors, dissolved oxygen sensors, pressure sensors,  and a YSI EXO2 sonde. Profiles were collected every ten minutes from the initial sensor deployment on 18 June 2020 to 31 December 2021. We deployed the 13 thermistors on a chain, with the deepest located about 0.5 m above the sediments. Because the water level in Beaverdam Reservoir varied from 9.70-12.48 m (mean=10.81 m, median=10.88 m) during the monitoring period, we will refer to the thermistors, dissolved oxygen, and pressure sensor by their position on the fixed thermistor chain as opposed to a specific depth, which roughly corresponds to the depth of the sensors at full pond in Beaverdam Reservoir (13.4 m). The thermistor closest to the top is labeled 1 and the deepest is labeled 13, with the intervening thermistors located at approximately ~1 m intervals. The dissolved oxygen sensors were deployed at positions 6 and 13, and the pressure sensor at position 13. 

To determine the variable depths of each sensor over time, we used observed water level and the pressure sensor at position 13 (which was fixed at  about 0.5 m above the sediments) to get the actual depth of the sensor when it is at the surface of the water. To do this, we converted the pressure readings from psi to depth in meters using 1 psi=0.70544 m found in the pressure gauge manual (Campbell Scientific CS451,https://s.campbellsci.com/documents/us/manuals/cs451-cs456.pdf). We then determine the date and time when the sensors are at the surface; the depth reading at that time is the depth at which the thermisptr is out of the water. This depth was put in the offset table (BVR_Depth_offsets_2020_2021.csv) and used to determine the depth of the sensor when it is below the surface and when the thermistor was out of the water.
In 2020, for thermistor 1, this happens on 2 July 2020 12:40, whereas the offset for thermistor 2 was on 14 July 20:00. Since the other sensors were never out of the water in 2020 we then assume they are equidistant from each other.  We subtracted the offset of position 2 from the offset of position 13, where the offset of position 13 was the difference between the pressure transducer and the thermistor at position 13 (6 cm). We then divided that number by the number of sensors below position 2 (11), which was equal to 1.038 m, the depth between the sensors at position 3-13. This number (1.038) was subtracted from the offset of each thermistor to find the subsequent offset of the thermistor in the position below. For example, to find the offset for position 3, we took the offset for position 2 (11.478) and subtracted 1.038 to get 10.44, which is the depth of the sensor at position 3 from the pressure sensor. 

On 05 April 2021 at 13:30, we secured the pressure sensor so it was in line with the thermistor at position 13, therefore the offset at position 13 is 0. At the end of the year in 2021 we recalculated the depth offsets for sensors at positions 3-13 because we moved the pressure sensor and the thermistor at position 3 was out of the water. We used this information to determine the depth of the sensor based on when it came out of the water at 10 September 2021 11:10. Since no other sensors below position 3 were out of the water we assume they are equidistant from each other and calculate the distance between sensors to be 1.047m. When or if other sensors have readings at the surface of the water we can confirm the depth of the sensors at more positions.  

Thus, to calculate the depth from the surface of each sensor, first subtract the unique offset for each sensor from column Depth_m_13, which is the depth of the pressure transducer at position 13 in meters.  Below is a table with the position of the sensor, the offset and the distance above the sediments.  
Since the EXO2 was deployed on a buoy that fluctuates with the water level changes, its sensors were always 1.5 m below the surface, regardless of water level. 

Offset Table:

The table below is the position of the sensor, offset to find the depth of the position from the top of the water at a given time, and the distance above the sediments when the sensors were deployed. To determine the depth of each position at a given time, you first need to go to the column Depth_m_13, which has the unique offset for the position. The R script, BVR_sort_by_depth_2020_2021.csv, attached to this package will do this for you and sort the depths into columns by the meter and variable. In the code, there are different sections for how to separate the data. The first section will put it into a long data frame where each reading has a depth associated with each reading; this is what HLW uses for BVR FLARE. The second half will put the data back into a wide format where the data is sorted by depth so there are some NAs when there is no data for that depth at a given time.

Calibration: 

The thermistor string was factory calibrated and verified against a NIST-traceable thermistor to meet measurement precision. The YSI EXO Sonde sensors, except for temperature, were factory calibrated before being deployed on 18 June 2020.

EXO Depth: 
On 13 August 2020 at 11:30, the EXO2 was redeployed 0.41m lower than before and stayed at this lower position for the rest of the year. On 05 April 2021 at 13:40, the EXO2 was redeployed because the original floating buoy had filled with water and sunk just below the surface. We recalibrated the depth sensor on the EXO2 and deployed the buoy at 1.5m using a boat fender and multipurpose clothesline wire. Because the EXO2 is vented but the cable is not, changes in barometric pressure are not accounted for. The EXO is currently deployed on a buoy at 1.5m regardless of the depth reading and usually sits at this depth unless there are issues with the buoy. On 09 November 2021 the water level had dropped so the EXO2 cable was taut and not supported by the buoy, more cable was let out until the buoy was floating again.   

DO Maintenance:
 
InSitu RDO Pro-X Dissolved Oxygen Sensors were calibrated on 16 September 2020, 26 October 2020, 8 March 2021, and checked on 26 October 2021.  The caps to the DO sensors were replaced on 26 Ocotober 2021 with the calibration checked but not calibrated. The antifouling guard was removed on 26 October 2021 due to concerns of lack of water exchange with the sensor. 

EXO2 DO sensor was calibrated on 16 September 2020, 26 October 2020, 8 March 2021, 12 July 2021 with air saturated water. The DO cap was changed on 12 July 2021. 

fDOM Maintenance:

EXO2 fDOM sensor was 0 calibrated on 5 April 2021.  


Missing Data:
The CR6 program on the datalogger underwent maintenance on 13 August 2020, 5 October 2020,  7 December 2020, 5 April 2021, 31 May 2021, and 24 August 2021 so no data were recorded during these times: 2020-08-13 05:20-05:50, 2020-10-05 09:20-12:00, 2020-12-07 10:10-10:40, 2021-04-05 13:20:00-14:40:00, 2021-05-31 08:50:00-09:10:00, and 2021-08-24 07:30:00- 07:50:00. 

The turbidity sensor on the EXO2 was added to the data frame on 5 April 2021. 


QAQC Methods:

Maintenance data gaps:
The sensor string was regularly brought up to the surface for routine maintenance, the dates and times of which were recorded in the BVR_MaintenanceLog_2020_2021.txt file. To account for these gaps in sensor data, we used an automated QAQC script (BVR_platform_QAQC_function_2020_2021.R script), which indexed the dates and times recorded in the maintenance log and set the data to NA and the corresponding flag column to 1. Any other maintenance, outlier and questionable values were also recorded in the maintenance log. 

QAQC Dissolved Oxygen values: 
After the sensors are pulled up DO values are changed to NA and flagged up to 2 hours after the sensors are back in the water. This ensures the sensors equilibrate after a cleaning and being in air.

Thermistors: 
Thermistors 11, 12, and 13 were not programmed until 5 October 2020, so all readings prior to that time are NA and given a “flag 1” for maintenance.  In Flag_Temp_11, Flag_Temp_12, and Flag_Temp_13. When the water level was lower than thermistors at position 1 through 3  and they were reading the temperature of the air, their readings were changed to NA and given a “flag 2”.

EXO Maintenance and QAQC:
The EXO2 was removed from the reservoir on 06 December 2021 11:00 and sent back to YSI (Yellow Springs, OH) for winter maintenance.

EXO Chlorophyll-a and Phycocyanin: 
The chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin sensor data underwent a QAQC process to remove extreme outliers (see ‘chla and phyco qaqc’ section of BVR_platform_QAQC_function_2020_2021.R script) following established protocols for Falling Creek Reservoir. Outliers were defined as absolute values greater than four standard deviations from previous and subsequent measurements for each individual observation. These outliers were set to NA and identified in the Flag_Chla or Flag_Phyco column as a value of 2. 

EXO fDOM: 
fDOM sensor data underwent a QAQC process to remove extreme outliers (see ‘fdom qaqc’ section of  BVR_platform_QAQC_function_2020_2021.R script) following established protocols for Falling Creek Reservoir. Outliers were defined as absolute values greater than two standard deviations from previous and subsequent measurements for each individual observation. These outliers were set to NA and identified in the Flag_fDOM column as a value of 2. 

EXO conductivity, Specific Conductivity and Total Dissolved Solids:
These sensors underwent a QAQC process to remove extreme outliers (see cond, spcond and TDS qaqc sensor of  BVR_platform_QAQC_function_2020_2021.R script)  following established protocols for Falling Creek Reservoir. Outliers were defined as absolute values greater than two standard deviations from previous and subsequent measurements for each individual observation. These outliers were set to NA and identified in the Flag_fDOM column as a value of 2. 

EXO Turbidity: 
These sensors underwent a QAQC process to remove extreme outliers (see turbidity qaqc sensor of  BVR_platform_QAQC_function_2020_2021.R script)  following established protocols for Falling Creek Reservoir. Outliers were defined as absolute values greater than two standard deviations from previous and subsequent measurements for each individual observation. These outliers were set to NA and identified in the Flag_fDOM column as a value of 2.

Please note: When pulling the file via EDI's API, we recommend using the function "read.csv" instead of "read_csv". The function 'read_csv' identifies the columns for the VT data and associated flags as "logical" instead of "double" due to >100 NA's at the beginning of the dataset. This is avoided when using the function "read.csv".
