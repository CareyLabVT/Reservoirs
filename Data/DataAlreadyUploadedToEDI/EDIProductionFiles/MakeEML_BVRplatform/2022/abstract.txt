We monitored water quality in Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA, 37.31288, -79.8159) with high-frequency (10-minute and 15-minute) sensors in 2016-2022. This data package is comprised of 2 data sets,BVR_sensor_string_2016_2020.csv and BVR_platform_data_2020_2022.csv. BVR_sensor_string_2016_2022.csv is comprised of a temperature profile at ~1-meter intervals from the surface of the reservoir to 10.5 m below the water, complemented by a dissolved oxygen logger at 5m or 10 depending on the time of year. A sonde measuring temperature, conductivity, specific conductance, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, fluorescent dissolved organic matter, and turbidity was deployed at ~1.5 m depth. This data set is complete and will not be added to any more. The second data set is BVR_platform_data_2020_2022.csv, which will be updated every year. This data set contains a temperature string with 13 temperature sensors about ~1 m apart from above the surface to 0.5 m above the sediment of the reservoir, with 2 oxygen sensors, one in the middle of the string and one sensor on the bottom, and a pressure sensor at the bottom as well. The same sonde previously mentioned is also in this data set deployed at 1.5 m below the surface. The temperature string with the thermistors, dissolved oxygen sensor, and pressure sensor are permanintly fixed to the platform and water level changes around them. In the methods we describe how to add a depth measurement to each observation. All variables were measured at the deepest site of the reservoir adjacent to the dam. Beaverdam Reservoir is owned and managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority as a secondary drinking water source for Roanoke, Virginia.
