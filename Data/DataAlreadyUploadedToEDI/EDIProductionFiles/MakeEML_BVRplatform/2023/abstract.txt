We monitored water quality in Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA, 37.31288, -79.8159) with high-frequency (10-minute and 15-minute) sensors in 2016-2023. All variables were measured at the deepest site of the reservoir adjacent to the dam. Beaverdam Reservoir is owned and managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority as a secondary drinking water source for Roanoke, Virginia. This data package is comprised of 2 data sets: BVR_sensor_string_2016_2020.csv and BVR_platform_data_2020_2023.csv. BVR_sensor_string_2016_2020.csv consists of a temperature profile at ~1-meter intervals from the surface of the reservoir to 10.5 m below the water, complemented by a dissolved oxygen logger at 5 m or 10 m depending on the time of year. A sonde measuring temperature, conductivity, specific conductance, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, fluorescent dissolved organic matter, and turbidity was deployed at ~1.5 m depth. This initial data set spans 2016 to 2020, with no additional data collection beyond the last observation. The second data set is BVR_platform_data_2020_2023.csv, with data collection still ongoing. This data set contains 1) a temperature string with 13 temperature sensors ~1 m apart from the surface to 0.5 m above the sediments of the reservoir; 2) two oxygen sensors, one in the middle of the string and one sensor above the sediments; and 3) a pressure sensor just above the sediments. The same sonde from the first 2016-2020 data set is also included in this 2020-2023 data set, deployed at 1.5 m below the surface. The temperature string with the thermistors, dissolved oxygen sensor, and pressure sensor are permanently fixed to the platform despite changes in water level. In the methods we describe how to add a depth measurement to each observation.
