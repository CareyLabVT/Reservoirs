We monitored water quality in Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA, 37.31288, -79.8159) with high-frequency (10-minute and 15-minute) sensors in 2015-2023. All variables were measured at the deepest site of the reservoir adjacent to the dam. Beaverdam Reservoir is owned and managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority as a secondary drinking water source for Roanoke, Virginia. This data package is comprised of three datasets: 1) BVR_Daily_WaterLevel_Vol_2015_2022_interp.csv, 2) BVRSensorString_2016_2020.csv, and 3) BVRPlatform_2020_2023.csv. 1) BVR_Daily_WaterLevel_Vol_2015_2022_interp.csv contains daily water level and volume from 7 July 2015 - 4 May 2022, based on both observations and modeling. 2) BVRSensorString_2016_2020.csv consists of a water temperature profile at ~1-meter intervals from the surface of the reservoir to 10.5 m below the water, complemented by a dissolved oxygen logger at 5 m or 10 m depending on the time of year. A sonde measuring water temperature, conductivity, specific conductance, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, fluorescent dissolved organic matter, and turbidity was additionally deployed at ~1.5 m depth. This dataset spans 2016 to 2020, with no additional data collection beyond the last observation. The third dataset is BVRPlatform_2020_2023.csv, with data collection still ongoing. This dataset contains: a) a temperature string with 13 temperature sensors ~1 m apart from the surface to 0.5 m above the sediments of the reservoir; b) two dissolved oxygen sensors, one in the middle of the string and one sensor above the sediments; and 3) a pressure sensor just above the sediments. The same sonde from the first 2016-2020 dataset is also included in this 2020-2023 dataset, deployed at 1.5 m below the surface. The sensors on the temperature string (thermistors, dissolved oxygen sensors, and pressure sensor) are permanently fixed to the platform and do not change with the water level. In the methods, we describe how to add a depth measurement to each observation.
