We monitored water quality in Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA) with high-frequency (10-minute or 15-minute) sensors in 2016-2020. Beaverdam Reservoir is owned and managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority as a secondary drinking water source for Roanoke, Virginia. Depth profiles of water temperature were measured by HOBO temperature loggers on ~1-meter intervals from the surface of the reservoir to 10.5 m below the water, complemented by a dissolved oxygen logger (MiniDot). A YSI EXO2 sonde measuring temperature, conductivity, specific conductance, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, fluorescent dissolved organic matter, and turbidity was deployed at ~1.5 m depth. Dissolved oxygen was monitored at 5m and 10m. All variables were measured at the deepest site of the reservoir adjacent to the dam.
