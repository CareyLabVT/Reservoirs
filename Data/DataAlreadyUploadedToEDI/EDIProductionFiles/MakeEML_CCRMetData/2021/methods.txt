Meteorological data were collected from 2021 using a research-grade meteorological station from Campbell Scientific (Logan, UT, USA). Data were collected at 1 minute intervals from 2021-03-29 19:00 to 2021-12-31 23:59. All observations are recorded in the GMT -5 time zone (Eastern Standard time) without any time zone changes in the data record.

Description of the battery and power flow: The meteorological station is powered with AC power from the power grid to power the CR3000 data logger and sensors.

The Meteorological station was deployed on the concrete walkway on top of the dam at Carvins Cove as such, some of the sensors may be influenced by the dam and structures on the dam itself. Most notably the 4-Component Net Radiometer sensor made up of Shortwave Radiation Up, Shortwave Radiation Down, Infrared Radiation Up and Infrared Radiation Down are hanging over the dam to measure the water below but may be obstructed by the dam.

Data Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) procedures: Missing data: Major gaps lasting longer than 1 day in the record occurred during these intervals: A Sub-daily gap occurred on 2021-04-09 13:00-13:56.

We automated QA/QC with an R script (archived with this dataset) that set flags and removed outliers. Smaller gaps in data for a few hours or less due to maintenance occurred throughout the dataset. We set erroneous values due to maintenance as NA (flag 1) in the dataset. For all flag descriptions, see the data table "CCR_Met_Maintenance.txt". There is only one flag per variable in the dataset with all unique flag values; flag 1 for maintenance in some cases overwrote other existing flags. All previously existing NAs due to missing observations other than maintenance were flagged as 2. Negative values were set to 0 for all meteorological variable columns except AirTemp_Average_C and data logger variables and flagged as 3. Values over 100% were set to 100 for Relative Humidity. Infinite values were set to NA for all variables and flagged as 3. The AirTemp_Average_C variable received intensive QA/QC based on the same QA/QC done for Falling Creek Reservoir Met station (EDI package edi.389.6). We used the data from the initial year of deployment (2021) to develop a linear relationship to predict AirTemp_Average_C from CR3000Panel_temp_C, the Campbell logger panel temperature sensor.

The 2015 relationship can be described by the following equation: AirTemp_Average_C = -3.5595812(0.0044426, 1 SE) + 0.9288955(0.0001895)_CR3000Panel_temp_C This relationship's adjusted R-squared value was 0.98. The residuals from this equation were minimum: -6.6734, 1st quartile: -0.6145, median: 0.0319, 3rd quartile: 0.6333, and maximum: 6.6100. If any air temperature values were above or below 4 standard deviations of the residuals from the linear model, we removed that value (flag 4) and substituted it with a new value calculated from the panel temperature and the linear equation. This occurred for 410 observations during 2021.

PAR data greater than 12 umol_s_m2 for the average and 1 mmol_m2 for the total during the night were changed to NA and Flagged as 4. Sunlight was determined using the getSunlightTimes function in the Suncalc package in R (Thieurmel, B., Elmarhraoui, A. (2019).suncalc: Compute Sun Position, Sunlight Phases, Moon Position and Lunar Phase. R package version 0.5.0.).

After previously described adjustments, outliers were set to NA and received 'flag 4' in the dataset, following these outlier thresholds:

AirTemp_Average_C > 40.6; InfaredRadiationUp_Average_W_m2 < 150; InfraredRadiationDown_Average_W_m2 > 540; BP_Average_kPa < 95.5; PAR_Total_mmol_m2 > 200; ShortwaveRadiationUp_Average_W_m2 > 1500; ShortwaveRadiationDown_Average_W_m2 > 300; Albedo_Average_W_m2 > 1000; PAR_Average_umol_s_m2 > 3000; PAR_Total_mmol_m2 > 200

The outlier thresholds were developed by comparison with the NOAA Roanoke Airport dataset. The Roanoke Airport is located ~6 km away from Carvins Cove Reservoir.

All QA/QC code used for the dataset is archived with this dataset.
