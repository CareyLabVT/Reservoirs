This dataset consists of variables measured by a research-grade Campbell Scientific meteorological station deployed on the dam of Carvins Cove Reservoir. Carvins Cove Reservoir (Roanoke, Virginia, USA; 37.36944, -79.95778), is owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority as a primary water source. The meteorological variables include photosynthetically active radiation, barometric pressure, ambient air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, wind speed and direction, shortwave radiation, infrared radiation, and albedo. All variables were measured every minute from 2021-03-29 19:00:00 to the end of the dataset at 2025-12-31 23:59:00, except for periods of maintenance. We applied extensive quality assurance/quality control protocols to the observations, as described in the methods. The dataset is accompanied by a sensor maintenance log and quality assurance/quality control analysis scripts.
