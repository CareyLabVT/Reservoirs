DATA COLLECTION

Meteorological data were collected using a research-grade meteorological station from Campbell Scientific (Logan, UT, USA) at 1-minute intervals from 2021-03-29 19:00 to 2025-12-31 23:59. All observations are recorded in the GMT -5 time zone (Eastern Standard time), without any time zone changes or daylight savings observed in the data record.

Site Description and Power:

The meteorological station was deployed on the concrete walkway on top of the dam at Carvins Cove Reservoir (CCR; 37.36944, -79.95778). Consequently, some of the sensors may be influenced by the dam and structures on the dam itself. Most notably, the 4-Component Net Radiometer sensor that records Shortwave Radiation Up, Shortwave Radiation Down, Infrared Radiation Up, and Infrared Radiation Down is hanging over the dam to measure the water below but may in some cases be obstructed by the dam during water level fluctuations.
The meteorological station (CR3000 data logger and sensors) is powered with AC power from the electrical grid.


DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL (QAQC) PROCEDURES 

Issues with the meteorological station:

On 2023-02-28, the meteorological station blew over in the early morning due to very high winds. We re-installed the tower that day and inspected the sensors. Luckily, there was no damage to the sensors; we removed observations during the interval when the station was cattywampus. The anemometer was not put back in the same position as before the tower fell over but in a slightly different adjacent location on the dam to prevent future damage during windstorms. We offset all WindDir_degrees observations by 47 degrees after the redeployment of the anemometer to ensure that the time series was robust, as there was a 47 degree increase (on average) after the tower fell over. The observations were corrected and flagged with a 4. See the Maintenance Log for exact times.

Missing data for all variables: 

There were no major gaps lasting longer than 1 day in the record for all observations though there sub-daily gaps for all variables. See sections below for gaps in individual variables. Most of the sub-daily gaps that occurred for all variables are because of maintenance and/or new programs being uploaded to the data logger, which occurred on 2021-04-09 13:00-13:56, 2021-07-02 14:00-14:41, 2022-04-05 12:00:00-13:56, 2022-04-20 13:00-13:38 and 14:00:00-14:53, 2022-05-12 10:00-10:27, and 2022-09-29 14:00-14:57:00, and 15:00-15:18. In 2023, sub-daily gaps occured on 2023-01-24 16:47:00 - 16:49:00,  2023-02-28 12:10:00 - 12:12:00, 2023-03-13 14:10:00 - 14:13:00, 2023-06-07 11:30:00 - 11:40:00, 12:04:00 - 12:06:00, 12:20:00 - 12:24:00, 12:26:00 - 12:28:00, 2023-06-27 11:00:00 - 11:15:00, and 2023-10-16 14:48:00 - 14:50:00. In 2024, there were no gaps that affected all variables in the data file but there were gaps for individual sensors, which are described below. 

In 2025, there were several all-variable sub-daily gaps. The gaps at the end of the year were because of a skipped scan in the program. The gaps occurred on 2025-04-03 09:20:00-09:30:00; 2025-04-03 09:50:00 - 11:00:00; 2025-04-03 11:10:00 - 11:15:00; 2025-04-03 12:08:00 - 12:11:00; 2025-07-30 12:50:00 - 13:01:00; 2025-08-21 14:30:00 - 16:11:00; 2025-09-04 03:30:00 - 03:41:00; 2025-09-06 13:10:00 - 15:11:00; 2025-10-05 06:00:00 - 06:11:00; 2025-10-30 07:40:00 - 07:51:00;2025-11-11 11:10:00 - 12:31:00; 2025-11-20 23:50:00 - 00:11:00; 2025-11-25 14:30:00 - 14:38:00; 2025-12-10 01:40:00 - 01:51:00; 2025-12-20 17:00:00 - 21:01:00; 2025-12-29 01:40:00 - 04:01:00. 

Maintenance Log and QAQC:

The Maintenance log, ccre-met_maintenancelog_2021_2025.csv, is a file in which we record maintenance or issues with the sensors so they can be flagged, modified, or removed from the data file. The maintenance log then updates the data using the qaqc_ccrmet() function in the ccre-met_qaqc_2021_2025.R script. In addition to removing observations from maintenance periods, the script also flags and removes values that are outliers. Below, we describe those thresholds and situations. The years on the QAQC function indicate which years are run through the function.  

All QAQC code used for the dataset is archived with this dataset (see ccre-met_qaqc_2021_2025.R). In addition to the QAQC script, we have included a visual inspection script which uses the current files, checks for NAs in the flag columns, visually checks to make sure the maintenance log worked properly, creates QAQC plots for inspections, saves the data file will all of the available cleaned data, and downloads files and scripts that are uploaded to EDI with this data package. 


Flag Descriptions:

We set erroneous values due to maintenance as NA (flag 1) in the dataset. For all flag descriptions, see the data table metadata below. There is only one flag per an observation in some cases; flag 1 for maintenance overwrote other existing flags. All previously existing NAs due to missing observations other than maintenance were flagged as 2. Negative values were set to 0 for all meteorological variable columns, except AirTemp_C_Average and variables measured inside the data logger (i.e., Record, CR3000Battery_V, and CR3000Panel_Temp_C), and flagged as 3. Two other variables were flagged as 3: if the relative humidity was greater than 100%, it was set to 100%, and if infrared radiation was recorded as an infinite value, it was set to NA. Outliers or obvious problems with the sensor were changed to NA and flagged as 4, while potentially questionable values that were left in the dataset were flagged as 5. 


Air Temperature:
The AirTemp_C_Average variable received intensive QAQC based on the same QAQC applied to the Falling Creek Reservoir meteorological station (EDI package edi.389). We used the data from the initial year of deployment (2021) to develop a linear relationship to predict AirTemp_C_Average from CR3000Panel_temp_C, the Campbell logger panel temperature sensor. The 2021 relationship can be described by the following equation: AirTemp_C_Average = -3.5595812(0.0044426, 1 SE) + 0.9288955(0.0001895)_CR3000Panel_temp_C. This relationship's adjusted R-squared value was 0.98. The residuals from this equation were minimum: -6.6734, 1st quartile: -0.6145, median: 0.0319, 3rd quartile: 0.6333, and maximum: 6.6100. If any air temperature values were above or below 4 standard deviations of the residuals from the linear model, we removed that value (flag 4) and substituted it with a new value calculated from the panel temperature and the linear equation. 

Relative Humidity:
The humidity sensor malfunctioned in 2022 and was reading NA. These observations are flagged as 2 for missing. The issue was resolved on 2020-06-22 20:23. 

PAR Sensor:
PAR data during the night that was greater than 12 umol_s_m2 (average) and 1 mmol_m2 (total) were changed to NA and flagged as 4. We used the getSunlightTimes function in the Suncalc package in R (Thieurmel, B., Elmarhraoui, A. (2019). suncalc: Compute Sun Position, Sunlight Phases, Moon Position and Lunar Phase. R package version 0.5.0.) to get sunrise and sunset times that determined whether the observation occurred during the day or at night. From 2022-07-01 to 2023-01-24, the PAR sensor was removed and a newly-calibrated replacement was deployed on 2023-01-24 (see serial numbers below). 

Rain Gauge:
The rain gauge was clogged from 2022-07-19 to 2022-09-12 11:07. For this time period, we corrected the observations using the rain gauge observations from Falling Creek Reservoir. Using data from the rain gauges at FCR (Falling Creek Reservoir) and CCR from 2021-03-29 19:00 to 2022-07-18 00:00, we developed a linear model (y=0.110725x+0.001494). We compared total rain from the raw data which includes when the rain gauge was unclogged and the corrected rain totals. The total for that time was 38.1 mm and the corrected total was 34.7 mm. 

Clarify Direction of Net Radiometer:
Net Radiometer is made up of shortwave and infared sensors pointed down towards the reservoir and up to the sky. In the column names, the direction listed is the way the sensor is oriented. Thus, ShortwaveRadiationUp_Average_W_m2 is pointed up to the sky, while ShortwaveRadiationDown_Average_W_m2 is pointed down towards the water. 

Outliers:
After previously described adjustments, outliers were set to NA and received 'flag 4' in the dataset, following these outlier thresholds:
AirTemp_Average_C > 40.6; InfaredRadiationUp_Average_W_m2 < 150; InfraredRadiationDown_Average_W_m2 > 540; BP_Average_kPa < 95.5; PAR_Total_mmol_m2 > 200; ShortwaveRadiationUp_Average_W_m2 > 1500; ShortwaveRadiationDown_Average_W_m2 > 300; Albedo_Average_W_m2 > 1000; PAR_Average_umol_s_m2 > 3000; PAR_Total_mmol_m2 > 200; WindSpeed_Average_m_s > 50; and Rain_Total_mm > 5.

The outlier thresholds were developed by comparison with the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
) Roanoke Airport dataset. The Roanoke Airport is located ~6 km away from Carvins Cove Reservoir.

QAQC scripts:

We used a QAQC function to remove maintenance times and outliers from the data before publishing. The function is included in the data package as an R script, ccre-met_qaqc_2021_2025.R. In this function, we flag and remove observations that were collected during sensor maintenance or when a sensor malfunctioned and there were outliers. 

For removing and flagging maintenance issues, all maintenance is recorded in the maintenance log (ccre-met_maintenancelog_2021_2025.csv). This file is used in the QAQC function to identify dates and times during recorded events (e.g., maintenance), change the observations affected, and add a flag to indicate the issues. See Maintenance Log and QAQC section above for more information on the maintenance log. In addition to recorded maintenance issues, we identify and remove issues and outliers as described above.

In addition to the QAQC script, we have included a visual inspection script (ccre-met_inspection_2021_2025.Rmd) which uses the current files, checks for NAs in the flag columns, visually checks to make sure the maintenance log worked properly, creates qaqc plots for visual inspection of the data, creates the newest data file by merging the cleaned data files for this year and previous years, and downloads files and scripts to be uploaded with the data package.
