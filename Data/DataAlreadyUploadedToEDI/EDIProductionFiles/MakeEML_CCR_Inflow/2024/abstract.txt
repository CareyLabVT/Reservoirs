Discharge rates, stage, and water temperature of the Horsepen Branch inflow tributary into Carvins Cove Reservoir (Roanoke, Virginia, USA), were measured on a 10-minute temporal resolution from April 2024 to December 2025. The pressure transducer monitoring location is located at 37.3646, -79.9733. Carvins Cove Reservoir is a drinking water supply reservoir owned and managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority (WVWA). The dataset consists of water temperatures and pressure that were measured during two different sensor deployments from a stationary monitoring location in a PVC stilling well. These data are converted to water level using atmospheric pressure corrections and field collected verification data. The dataset is accompanied by a sensor maintenance log and quality assurance/quality control analysis scripts.
