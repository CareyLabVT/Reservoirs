### Data Package Overview:

We calculated high-frequency (10-minute) stage and discharge on the Horsepen Branch Tributary of Carvins Cove Reservoir using a pressure transducer deployed in the stream bed. A HOBO pressure transducer (Pressure (Absolute) and Water Level Measurements U20L-01; HOBO, Bourne, MA, USA) was used to measure 10-minute underwater pressure in the stream channel. A research grade meteorological station deployed on the Carvins Cove Reservoir Dam (~1.5 km from the stream site) was used to measure atmospheric barometric pressure which was used to correct in stream pressure (Carey & Breef-Pilz 2026). 


### Sensor deployments:

Pressure transducers were deployed in a PVC cage that allowed for water exchange in the middle of the stream channel that experienced near continuous flow throughout a year. The PVC cage was attached to a steel fence T-post that was driven into the bottom on the stream bed. Pressure transducers were attached to a cable and lowered to the bottom of the PVC cage so the sensor sat just above the streambed. Sensors were set to log pressure and water temperature data every 10-minutes and were downloaded approximately monthly.

Two separate HOBO pressure transducers were used in this monitoring campaign do the loss of one sensor in a large storm. The first sensor was deployed from 23 April 2024 - 17 December 2024. The sensor was likely lost during a large storm in February 2025 where PVC cage and fence post were dislodged and the HOBO sensor was lost. A second sensor was redeployed in the same location from 16 April 2025 - 2 December 2025 at the time of this data publication. 


### Stage and Discharge calculations:

To calculate the stream level stage and discharge, the pressure readings from the in stream pressure transducers had to be corrected for atmospheric pressure. We used atmospheric pressure data from the Carvins Cove Reservoir dam to correct in stream pressure where corrected pressure = in stream pressure - atmospheric pressure.

Stream stage is reported in centimeters was calculated using the following conversion: Water Level (cm) = Pressure (kPa) * 10.1972.

Discharge was calculate by developing a rating curve between sensor derived stage data and manually measured discharge using the velocity-area method with a flowmeter (see Carey et al. 2026 for further methods). We fit a rating curve following the equation: Discharge = a * Stage^b, using the nls function in the stats package in R (R Core Team 2024). Discharge rate are reported in m^3 s^-1. 


### Data Flags:

Data Flags are reported for each variable in the data set. 
Flag of 0 = No Flag
Flag of 1 = Data removed and set to NA due to maintenance 
Flag of 2 = Data from the first PT sensor deployment (see methods)
Flag of 4 = Offset to stage data applied
Flag of 5 = Negative pressure values that were retained in the data set
Flag of 6 = Dishcarge values that were greater than observed discharge used to generate the rating curve. These values are suspect and should be treated with caution.



### Data Gaps: 

Sub daily gaps in data may have occurred on days when the sensor was downloaded.

Multi-day gaps in data occurred between 17 December 2024 - 16 April 2025 due to a missing sensor. A second gap occurred from 14 September to 14 October 2025.


### Notes

All observations are in EST with daylight savings not observed.
