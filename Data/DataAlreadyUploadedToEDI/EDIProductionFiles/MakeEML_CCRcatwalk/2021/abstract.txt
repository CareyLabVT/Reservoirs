We monitored water quality in Carvins Cove Reservoir (Roanoke, Virginia, USA) with high-frequency (10-minute) sensors in 2021. Carvins Cove Reservoir is owned and managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority as a primary drinking water source for Roanoke, Virginia. Depth profiles of water temperature were measured on ~1-meter intervals from 0.1 m below the surface of the reservoir to 11 m depth and additionally at 15 and 19 m. A YSI EXO2 sonde measured temperature, conductivity, specific conductance, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter at ~1.5 m depth. A YSI EXO3 sonde measured temperature, conductivity, specific conductance, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter at ~9m which correlates with a water outtake valve depth. Due to variable water levels in the reservoir, the position of all the  sensors are held stationary and presented as positions (thermistor temperature, EXO2, EXO3, and pressure sensor). All variables were measured with sensors deployed off of the dam near the water outtake valves. At this site the reservoir is approximately 19 m deep (reservoir max depth is 23 m).
