We monitored water quality in Carvins Cove Reservoir (Roanoke, Virginia, USA) with high-frequency (10-minute) sensors in 2020-2022. Carvins Cove Reservoir is owned and managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority as a primary drinking water source. Using HOBO temperature pendants, depth profiles of water temperature were measured on 1-meter intervals from 0.1 m below the surface of the reservoir to 10 m depth and additionally at 15 and 20 m from July 2020 - August 2021. Water temperature was also measured in the Sawmill Branch inflow using HOBO temperature pendants from July 2020 - April 2021. In May 2021, new NexSens thermistors were deployed and depth profiles of water temperature were measured on 1-meter intervals from 0.1 m below the surface of the reservoir to 11 m depth and additionally at 15 and 19 m. In 2021, a YSI EXO2 sonde measured temperature, conductivity, specific conductance, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter at ~1.5 m depth. A YSI EXO3 sonde measured temperature, conductivity, specific conductance, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter at 9 m, which corresponds to the depth of a water outtake valve. The thermistors, EXO3, and pressure sensor are deployed at stationary, fixed elevations (referred to as positions) deployed off of the dam near the water outtake valves. Due to variable water levels in the reservoir, the depths of these sensors thus vary over time. In contrast, the EXO2 is deployed on a buoy at the same site and thus always remains at 1.5 m depth as water level fluctuates. At this site the reservoir is approximately 19 m deep (reservoir max depth is 23 m). The Sawmill Branch sensors were deployed at 0.5 m depth in the stream.
