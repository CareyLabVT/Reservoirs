    <abstract>
      <para>We monitored water quality in Carvins Cove Reservoir (Roanoke, Virginia, USA) with high-frequency (10-minute) sensors in 2020-2022. Carvins Cove Reservoir is owned and managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority as a primary drinking water source. This data packages consists of multiple data sets. First, using HOBO temperature pendants, depth profiles of water temperature were measured on 1-meter intervals from 0.1 m below the surface of the reservoir to 10 m depth and additionally at 15 and 20 m from July 2020 - August 2021. Second, water temperature was also measured in the Sawmill Branch inflow using HOBO temperature pendants from July 2020 - April 2021. Third, in May 2021, new NexSens thermistors were deployed and depth profiles of water temperature were measured on 1-meter intervals from 0.1 m below the surface of the reservoir to 11 m depth and additionally at 15 and 19 m. In 2021, a YSI EXO2 sonde was deployed that measured temperature, conductivity, specific conductance, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter at ~1.5 m depth. A YSI EXO3 sonde was also deployed in 2021 that measured temperature, conductivity, specific conductance, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter at 9 m, which corresponds to the depth of a water outtake valve. The thermistors, EXO3, and pressure sensor are deployed at stationary, fixed elevations (referred to as positions) deployed off of the dam near the water outtake valves. Due to variable water levels in the reservoir, the depths of these sensors thus vary over time. In contrast, the EXO2 is deployed on a buoy at the same site and thus always remains at 1.5 m depth as water level fluctuates. At this site the reservoir is approximately 19 m deep (reservoir max depth is 23 m). The Sawmill Branch sensors were deployed at 0.5 m depth in the stream.</para>

        <description>
          <para>Data from multiple water quality sensors were collected from a fixed point, near the dam of Carvins Cove reservoir (Site 51, Lat: 37.3697, Long: -79.958). </para>
          <para>First, in data file CCR_hobos_20_21.csv, we measured depth profiles of water temperature were measured at Carvins Cove Reservoir from July 2020 - August 2021 using HOBO temperature pendants (HOBO Pendant Temperature/Light Data Logger, Onset, Bourne, MA, USA) that were deployed from a buoy at fixed depths from the surface. HOBO temperature pendants were deployed at 1-meter intervals from 0.1 m below the surface of the reservoir to 10 m depth and additionally at 15 and 20 m. A HOBO temperature pendant was also deployed in the Sawmill Branch inflow from July 2020 - April 2021, at approximately 0.5 m depth. HOBO temperature pendant manual from manufacturer can be found here: https://www.onsetcomp.com/sites/default/files/resources-documents/9556-M%20UA-002%20Manual.pdf.</para>
          <para>Second, in data file CCR_Catwalk_EDI_2021_2022.csv, we measured depth profiles of multiple water quality variables were collected off of the dam at Carvins Cove Reservoir in 2021-2022 using water temperature thermistors, pressure sensors, and a YSI EXO2 and an EXO3 sonde. Profiles were collected every ten minutes from the initial sensor deployment on 9 April 2021 to 31 December 2022. There are 13 NexSens thermistors on a chain and when the reservoir is at full pond the deepest thermistor is at 19 meters.  Because the water level in Carvins Cove Reservoir varied from 17.7-19.6 m (mean=18.7 m, median=18.6 m) during the monitoring period, we will refer to the thermistors and the pressure sensor by their position on the fixed thermistor chain as opposed to a specific depth. These positions were selected based on the depth when the reservoir is at full pond. The thermistor closest to the top (to represent 0.1 m at full pond) is labeled 1 and the 8 m thermistor (when at full pond) is labeled 9, with the intervening thermistors located at approximately 1 m intervals. Thermistors 10 and 11 are deployed to represent 10 m and 11 m when at full pond, respectively. Thermistors 12 and 13 are deployed to represent 15 m and 19 m when at full pond, respectively. The pressure sensor is deployed 0.15 m below the thermistor at position 13. The YSI EXO3 sonde was deployed at 9 m on 9 April 2021 at 14:00. The temperature string and pressure sensor was first deployed on 11 May 2021. The EXO2 at 1.5 m was deployed on 1 July 2021, although the data is not streaming wirelessly and needs to be manually downloaded (see the EXO maintenance for missing data). </para>
          <para>Third, in data file CCR_Depth_offsets_2021_2022.csv, to determine the variable depths of each sensor over time, we converted the pressure readings to depth using the relationship 1 psi=0.70544 m from the pressure gauge manual (Campbell Scientific CS451, https://s.campbellsci.com/documents/us/manuals/cs451-cs456.pdf). The offset values for positions 1 and 2 were determined to be the depth of the pressure transducer on the day that each thermistor was first at the surface of the water. For thermistor 1, the offset was equal to the depth of the pressure transducer on 25 May 2021 16:50, whereas the offset for thermistor 2 was equal to the depth of the pressure transducer on its deployment on 30 November 2021 16:20. Since the other sensors were equidistant from each other and the water level was never low enough to expose them out of the water, we subtracted the offset of position 2 from the offset of position 13, where the offset of position 13 was the difference between the pressure transducer and the thermistor at position 13 (15 m). We then divided that number by the number of whole meters below position 2 (18 m), which was equal to 0.995 m, which represents the depth between the deeper sensors. This number was subtracted from the offset of each thermistor to find the subsequent offset of the thermistor in the position below. For example, to find the offset for position 3, we took the offset for position 2 (18.065) and subtracted 0.995 to get 17.07, which is the depth of the sensor below the water. </para>
          <para>Thus, to calculate the depth of each sensor’s position, first subtract the unique offset for each sensor from data table column LvlDepth_m_13, which is the depth of the pressure transducer at position 13 in meters. Below is a table with the position of the sensor, the offset, and the distance above the sediments. </para>
          <para>Since the EXO2 was deployed on a buoy that fluctuates with the water level changes, its sensors were always 1.5 m below the surface, regardless of water level. For the EXO3 at 9 m, there is a depth sensor on the instrument so each reading has a depth associated with it. The depth of the EXO3 was always between ThermistorTemp_C_9 and ThermistorTemp_C_10.</para>
          <para>Offset Table:&#13;
The table below is the position of the sensor, offset to find the depth of the position from the top of the water at a given time, and the depth of the sensors when the reservoir depth was at full pond. To determine the depth of each position at a given time, you first need to go to the column LvlDepth_m_13, and subtract the offset for that position. The R script, CCR_sort_by_depth_2021_2022.csv, attached to this package will do this for you and sort the depths into columns by the 0.5 meter and variable (Temperature, Dissolved Oxygen, Dissolved oxygen saturation, and Pressure). It is sorted into 0.5 m increments because there were some issues with having two readings for 1 depth bin. </para>
          <para>Offset Table: &#13;
Position	Offset		Depth of the Sensor when full pond&#13;
Position 1	18.94		0.1m&#13;

          <para>The thermistor string was factory-calibrated and verified against a NIST-traceable thermistor to meet measurement precision. The YSI EXO2 and EXO3 Sonde sensors, except for temperature, were factory calibrated before being deployed on 1 July 2021 and 9 April 2021. The EXO2 FDOM and chlorophyll were zero calibrated on 1 July 2021 and the EXO3 FDOM and chlorophyll sensors were zero calibrated on 2 April 2021. The EXO2 dissolved oxygen sensor was calibrated on 1 July 2021 and the EXO3 dissolved oxygen sensor was calibrated on 09 April 2021. </para>
          <para>Missing Data and Issues</para>
          <para>Thermistors:</para>
          <para>The thermistor and other sensor data are potentially influenced by nightly management interventions at 3 am (EST). At 3 am on most nights there are slight changes in water temperature values. This is believed to be caused by blow-offs of air from water intake valves used to clear debris from intake pipes. This release of air can lead to short term changes in thermal stratification patterns. These events seem to only affect the temperature values at 3:00 am and occur predominantly in the summer months. </para>

          <para>Maintenance data gaps and QAQC:&#13;
Any time the temperature string, EXO2 or EXO3 was brought to the surface for routine maintenance, the dates and times were recorded in the CCRW_MaintenanceLog_2021_2022.txt file. To account for these gaps in sensor data, we used an automated QAQC function  (CCR_catwalk_QAQC_function_2021_2022.R) which indexed the dates and times recorded in the maintenance log and set the affected data to NA and set the appropriate flag columns to 1. Any data points outside of the immediate time frame that the sensor string was pulled up for maintenance do not reflect ambient conditions due to sensor re-equilibration and were also set to NA and flagged as 1.  In 2022 we added another QAQC step which identified and removed extreme outliers. For EXOChla_ugL, EXOChla_RFU, EXOBGAPC_RFU, and EXOBGAPC_ugL these are  4 standard deviations above or below the previous observation and the past observation. The rest of the other variables in the dataset used 2 standard deviations. All outliers were changed to NA and given a flag of 2. </para>

EXO Maintenance Issues:&#13;
In 2022 both of the EXOs were removed for cleaning and calibration on 12 December 2022. The EXO3 was returned on 16 December 2022 while the EXO2 was moved and placed at Beaverdam Reservoir for the winter.  &#13;
The central wiper (SN: 21A100323) on the EXO3 was malfunctioning during September 2021. All of the values for the EXO3 were removed during 7 September 2021 15:30 to 27 September 2021 8:30, this is documented in the CCRW_maintenance_log_2021_2022.txt. The central wiper was returned for maintenance and the central wiper (SN: 21A100324) on the EXO2 was moved to the EXO3 leaving the EXO2 without a central wiper. After this we made fortnightly to monthly trips to the reservoir to manually clean the EXO2 sensors with water and download data. This is documented in the maintenance log CCRW_maintenance_log_2021_2022.txt. A new wiper (SN: 21M102801 ) was installed on the EXO2 on 9 February 2022 10:30. </para>
          <para>The central wiper (21A100324) on the EXO3 failed again so data was removed from 14 January - 26 January 2022. After this the EXO3 and the wiper were sent back for servicing. The EXO3 was returned on 20 April 2022 with a new central wiper (SN: 22B106313)</para>
          <para>EXO Chlorophyll-a and Phycocyanin: &#13;
At 1.5 m, the EXO2 only recorded RFU and not micrograms per liter. There are two separate flag columns to note the difference. </para>
          <para>&#13;
EXO depth:</para>
          <para>If the EXO2 that normally sits at 1.5 m is above 1.0 m, the data are changed to NA and flagged with a 2 (for maintenance), as the EXO is out of position unless data have been flagged for maintenance. The EXO2 is out of position about once a day when the Water Authority sends water through the intake pipes to clear out debris. </para>
          <para>If the EXO3 that normally sits at 9 m is above 7 m, the data are changed to NA and flagged with a 2, as the EXO is out of position unless data have been flagged for maintenance. These changes in EXO3 position could have been due to debris from storms hitting sensors and causing them to be displaced, which happened two times during the year.</para>
