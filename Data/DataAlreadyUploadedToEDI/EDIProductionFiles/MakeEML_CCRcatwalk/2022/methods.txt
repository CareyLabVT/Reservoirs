This data package contains five different data tables: CCR_Catwalk_EDI_2021_2022.csv, CCR_Depth_offsets_2021_2022.csv, CCR_hobos_2020_2021.csv, CCRW_MaintenanceLog_2021_2022.csv, and reservoir_site_descriptions.csv. They are described below in the order they appear on EDI. 

First, in data file CCR_Catwalk_EDI_2021_2022.csv, we measured depth profiles of multiple water quality variables off of the dam at Carvins Cove Reservoir in 2021-2022 using water temperature thermistors, a pressure transducer, a YSI EXO2, and a YSI EXO3 sonde. Profiles were collected every ten minutes from the initial sensor deployment to 31 December 2022. The YSI EXO3 sonde was deployed at 9 m on 9 April 2021 at 14:00. The temperature string and pressure transducer were first deployed on 11 May 2021. There were 13 NexSens thermistors on a chain and when the reservoir was at full pond the deepest thermistor was at 19 meters.  Because the water level in Carvins Cove Reservoir varied from 17.7-19.6 m (mean=18.7 m, median=18.6 m) during the monitoring period, we referred to the thermistors and the pressure transducer by their position on the fixed thermistor chain as opposed to a specific depth. These positions were selected based on the depth when the reservoir was at full pond. The thermistor closest to the surface (when at full pond) was labeled 1 and the 8 m thermistor (when at full pond) was labeled 9, with the intervening thermistors located approximately 1 m apart. Thermistors 10 and 11 were deployed to represent 10 m and 11 m when at full pond, respectively. Thermistors 12 and 13 were deployed to represent 15 m and 19 m when at full pond, respectively. The pressure transducer was deployed 0.15 m below the thermistor at position 13. The EXO2 at 1.5 m was deployed on 1 July 2021, although the data were not streaming wirelessly until 26 January 2022. For more information on addressing the changing water level; see the section CCR_Depth_offsets_2021_2022.csv, for a detailed description of how to add a depth reading to each observation.

Sensor Maintenance Issues: 

Thermistors Issues:
The thermistors and other sensors data were potentially influenced by nightly management interventions at 3 am (EST). At 3 am on most nights, there were slight changes in water temperature values. This was believed to be caused by blow-offs of air from water intake valves used to clear debris from intake pipes. This release of air can lead to short-term changes in thermal stratification patterns. These events seem to only affect the temperature values at 3:00 am and occur predominantly in the summer months. 

EXOs Issues:

In 2022 both of the EXOs were removed for cleaning and calibration on 12 December 2022. The EXO3 was returned on 16 December 2022 while the EXO2 was moved and placed at Beaverdam Reservoir for the winter.  
The central wiper (SN: 21A100323) on the EXO3 malfunctioned during September 2021, thus we removed all observations from 7 September 2021 15:30 to 27 September 2021 8:30. While the central wiper was sent back for maintenance, we took the central wiper (SN: 21A100324) from the EXO2 at 1.5 m and installed it on the EXO3 at 9 m. This left the EXO2 at 1.5 m without a central wiper, so we cleaned and downloaded data fortnightly to monthly until we installed a new wiper (SN: 21M102801) on the EXO2 on 9 February 2022 10:30.  The central wiper (21A100324) on the EXO3 failed again, we removed data from 14 January - 26 January 2022 due to interference in the readings from the wiper. We returned the EXO3 and the sonde for maintenance since this was the second wiper that failed. On 20 April 2022, we redeployed the EXO3 with a new wiper (SN: 22B106313). This was all documented in the maintenance log CCRW_maintenance_log_2021_2022.csv.

EXO Chlorophyll-a and Phycocyanin: 
From 1 July 2021 to 26 January 2022, the EXO2 only recorded RFU and not micrograms per liter (µg/L) for Chlorophyll-a and Phycocyanin. Once the EXO2 data were streaming there were observations in both RFU and micrograms per liter. To fill in the gaps, we back calculated the missing observations for micrograms per liter using a linear relationship of RFU to micrograms per liter. For chlorophyll the relationship was µg/L = 4*RFU -0.63 and for phycocyanin it was µg/L=1*RFU-0.59. These calculated values were flagged with a 6 (corrected with a linear relationship).

QAQC scripts:

We use a QAQC function to remove maintenance times and outliers from the data before publishing. The function is included in the data package as an R script, CCR_catwalk_QAQC_function_2021_2022.R. In this function, we flag and remove observations that took place during sensor maintenance or when a  sensor malfunctioned, when the sensors out of place, and when there were extreme outliers. 
For removing and flagging maintenance issues, all maintenance is recorded in the maintenance log (CCRW_MaintenanceLog_2021_2022.csv). This file is used in the QAQC function to identify dates and times during recorded events, change the observations affected and add a flag to indicate the issues. See CCRW_MaintenanceLog_2021_2022.csv section below for more information on the maintenance log. 
In addition to recorded maintenance issues, we also remove all observations from the EXOs when they are out of position. For the EXO2 it normally sits at 1.5 m, when the depth from the sensor is above 1.0 m we set all observations from the EXO2 to NA and flag with a 2 (for outlier set to NA). This happens for one observation once a day when the Water Authority purge their intake pipes.  The EXO3 normally sits at 9 m so when it is above 7 m, the data are changed to NA and flagged with a 2 (for outlier set to NA). In the past, this happened when the sensor was tangled on debris. 
Lastly, we identify and remove extreme outliers. For EXOChla_ugL, EXOChla_RFU, EXOBGAPC_RFU, and EXOBGAPC_ugL these are values 4 standard deviations above or below the previous observation and the past observation. The other variables in the dataset use 2 standard deviations. All outliers were changed to NA and given a flag of 2. 
This function is used in CCR_Catwalk_QAQC_plots_2021_2022.Rmd. In the R markdown the user downloads data, identifies gaps in the data, uses the QAQC function to clean the data, saves the maintenance file for EDI publishing, and produces QAQC plots for visual inspection.

Second, in data file CCR_Depth_offsets_2021_2022.csv, are the depth offsets for each position on the temperature string. These offsets are used to calculate the depth of the sensors below the surface of the water. We used this method to ensure we removed observations when the sensors were out of the water.  
To determine the variable depths of each sensor over time, we convert the pressure readings to depth readings, in meters, using the relationship 1 psi=0.70544 m from the pressure gauge manual (Campbell Scientific CS451, https://s.campbellsci.com/documents/us/manuals/cs451-cs456.pdf). The offset values for positions 1 and 2 were determined to be the depth of the pressure transducer when each thermistor was first at the surface of the water. For thermistor 1, the offset was equal to the depth of the pressure transducer on 25 May 2021 16:50, whereas the offset for thermistor 2 was equal to the depth of the pressure transducer on 30 November 2021 16:20. Since the other sensors were equidistant from each other and the water level was never low enough to expose them out of the water, we subtracted the offset of position 2 from the offset of position 13, which is 17.915 m. We divided that number (17.915) by the number of whole meters below position 2 (18 m), which was equal to 0.995 m. This means sensors we assumed were 1 meter apart are 0.995 meters apart. This number (0.995) was subtracted from the offset of each thermistor to find the subsequent offset of the thermistor in the position below. For example, to find the offset for position 3, we took the offset for position 2 (18.065) and subtracted 0.995 to get 17.07, which is the depth reading from the pressure transducer when position 3 is out of the water. The offset for position 13 is the distance of the thermistor from the pressure transducer. 

To calculate the depth below the water for each sensor’s position, first subtract the unique offset for each sensor from column LvlDepth_m_13, which is the depth of the pressure transducer. Below is a table with the position of the sensor, the offset, and the distance above the sediments. 

This only needs to happen for sensors deployed on the temperature sting. Since the EXO2 was deployed on a buoy that fluctuates with the water level changes, its sensors were always 1.5 m below the surface, regardless of water level. For the EXO3 at 9 m, there is a depth sensor on the instrument so each reading has a depth associated with it. The depth of the EXO3 was always between ThermistorTemp_C_9 and ThermistorTemp_C_10.

Offset Table:
The offset table is the same as CCR_Depth_offsets_2021_2022.csv.  The table below is the position of the sensor, offset to find the depth of the position from the top of the water at a given time, and the depth of the sensors when the reservoir depth is at full pond. To determine the depth of each position at a given time, you find the depth of the pressure transducer, in column LvlDepth_m_13, and subtract the offset for that position. The R script, CCR_sort_by_depth_2021_2022.csv, attached to this package will do this for you and sort the depths into columns by the 0.5 meter and variable (Temperature, Dissolved Oxygen, Dissolved oxygen saturation, and Pressure).

Third, in data file CCR_hobos_2020_2021.csv, we measured depth profiles of water temperature at Carvins Cove Reservoir from July 2020 - August 2021 using HOBO temperature pendant loggers (HOBO Pendant Temperature/Light Data Logger, Onset, Bourne, MA, USA) at site 50 and site 300 (see reservoir_site_description.csv). We deployed the loggers from a buoy at 1-meter intervals from just below the surface to 10 m depth and additionally at 15 and 20 m depth. After the streaming sensors from CCR_Catwalk_EDI_2021_2022.csv were installed, we removed the Hobo pendants from the reservoir.  We alsondeployed a HOBO temperature pendant in the Sawmill Branch inflow (site 300) from July 2020 - April 2021, at approximately 0.5 m depth. There were no maintenance or other issues flagged in this data file. 
The HOBO temperature pendant manual from the manufacturer can be found here: https://www.onsetcomp.com/sites/default/files/resources-documents/9556-M%20UA-002%20Manual.pdf.

Fourth, in data file CCRW_MaintenanceLog_2021_2022.csv, are dates and times the sensors were above the water for maintenance. Here we recorded when sensors were cleaned, removed for maintenance or other issues that should be noted. This file is used in the QAQC function which indexes the dates and times recorded in the maintenance log to set the affected data to NA and set the appropriate flags (CCR_catwalk_QAQC_function_2021_2022.R).  A description of the columns is in the Detailed Metadata under Data Entries. A description of how to use the function in the QAQC process is found under QAQC scripts.
