We monitored water quality in Carvins Cove Reservoir (Roanoke, Virginia, USA) with high-frequency (10-minute) sensors in 2020-2023. Carvins Cove Reservoir is owned and managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority as a primary drinking water source. This data packages consists of data sets from two separate deployments. First from July 2020 - August 2021, using HOBO temperature pendant loggers, depth profiles of water temperature were measured on 1-meter intervals from 0.1 m below the surface of the reservoir to 10 m depth, and at 15 and 20 m depth.  Additionally, water temperature was also measured in the Sawmill Branch inflow at 0.5 m using HOBO temperature pendant loggers. Second, in spring 2021 - 31 December 2023, depth profiles of water temperature were measured on 1-meter intervals from 0.1 m below the surface of the reservoir to 11 m depth and additionally at 15 and 19 m. A YSI EXO2 sonde measured temperature, conductivity, specific conductance, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter at about 1.5 m depth. A YSI EXO3 sonde measured temperature, conductivity, specific conductance, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter at 9 m depth, which corresponds to the depth of a water outtake valve. The thermistors, EXO3, and pressure sensor are deployed at stationary, fixed elevations (referred to as positions) deployed off of the dam near the water outtake valves. Due to variable water levels in the reservoir, the depths of these sensors thus vary over time. In contrast, the EXO2 is deployed on a buoy (2021-2022) at the same site and thus always remains at 1.5 m depth as water level fluctuates. In 2023, EXO2 was no longer on a buoy and thus the water level flcutated around the sensor. At this site the reservoir is approximately 19 m deep (reservoir max depth is 23 m).
