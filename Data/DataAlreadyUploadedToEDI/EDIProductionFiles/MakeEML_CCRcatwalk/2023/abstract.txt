We monitored water quality in Carvins Cove Reservoir (Roanoke, Virginia, USA) with high-frequency (10-minute) sensors in 2020-2023. Carvins Cove Reservoir is owned and managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority as a primary drinking water source. This data packages consists of datasets from two separate deployments. First, from July 2020 - August 2021, depth profiles of water temperature were measured on 1-meter intervals using HOBO temperature pendant loggers deployed from 0.1 m below the surface of the reservoir to 10 m depth, and also at 15 and 20 m depth. Additionally, water temperature was measured in the Sawmill Branch inflow at 0.5 m depth using HOBO temperature pendant loggers. Second, in spring 2021 - 31 December 2023, depth profiles of water temperature were measured on 1-meter intervals from 0.1 m below the surface of the reservoir to 11 m depth and additionally at 15 and 19 m. A YSI EXO2 sonde measured water temperature, conductivity, specific conductance, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter at ~1.5 m depth. A YSI EXO3 sonde measured water temperature, conductivity, specific conductance, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter at 9 m depth, which corresponds to the depth of a water outtake valve. The thermistors, EXO3 sonde, and pressure sensor were deployed at stationary, fixed elevations (referred to as positions) deployed off of the dam near the water outtake valves. Due to variable water levels in the reservoir, the depths of these sensors varied over time. In contrast, the EXO2 was deployed on a buoy from 2021-2022 and remained at 1.5 m depth as the water level fluctuated. However, in 2023, we lost the buoy and the EOX2 was stationary as the water level fluctuated around the sensor. At this site, the reservoir is approximately 19 m deep (reservoir max depth is 23 m).
