This data package contains five different data tables: CCRCatwalk_2021_2023.csv, CCRCatwalk_maintenancelog_2021_2023.csv, CCRCatwalk_Depth_offsets_2021_2023.csv, CCR_hobos_2020_2021.csv, reservoir_site_descriptions.csv. They are described below in the order they appear on EDI. 

First, in data file CCRCatwalk_2021_2023.csv, we measured depth profiles of multiple water quality variables off of the dam at Carvins Cove Reservoir (37.3697	-79.958) in 2021-2023 using water temperature thermistors, a pressure transducer, a YSI EXO2 sonde, and a YSI EXO3 sonde. Profiles were collected every ten minutes from the initial sensor deployment to 31 December 2023. The YSI EXO3 sonde was deployed at 9 m on 9 April 2021 at 14:00. The temperature string and pressure transducer were first deployed on 11 May 2021. There were 13 NexSens thermistors on a chain and when the reservoir was at full pond the deepest thermistor was at 19 meters. Because the water level in Carvins Cove Reservoir has varied from 15.7-19.6 m (mean=18.6 m, median=18.5 m) during the monitoring period, we refer to the thermistors and the pressure transducer by their position on the fixed thermistor chain as opposed to a specific depth. These positions were selected based on the depth when the reservoir was at full pond. The thermistor closest to the surface (when at full pond) was labeled 1, the 8 m thermistor (when at full pond) was labeled 9, with the intervening thermistors located approximately 1 m apart. Thermistors 10 and 11 were deployed to represent 10 m and 11 m when at full pond, respectively. Thermistors 12 and 13 were deployed to represent 15 m and 19 m when at full pond, respectively. The pressure transducer was deployed 0.15 m below the thermistor at position 13. To access the depth associated with each observation, use the 'find_depths' function in the find_depths.R file (see the CCR_Depth_offsets_2021_2023 section below for more information on how to use the function). The EXO2 was deployed on a buoy from 2021-2022 and remained at 1.5 m depth as the water level fluctuated. However, in 2023, we lost the buoy in a storm and the EOX2 was stationary as the water level fluctuated around the sensor. 

In 2023, the Western Virginia Water Authority lowered the water in the reservoir to do maintenance on the dam. Because of this, the sensors were at different depths than they would be normally. All sensors have a depth reading associated with them (See CCR_Depth_offsets_2021_2023.csv). On 18 September 2023, the water level was so low due to the reservoir's management that the EXO2 sonde was almost completely out of the water so we redeployed the sensor at ~1.5 m. When sensors were too far out of position (defined as less than 0.75 m for the EXO2 near the surface and less than 6 m for the EXO3, which sits at 9 m when the reservoir is at full pond), we flagged observations as 2 and values were set to NA. See the CCRCatwalk_maintenancelog_2021_2023.csv for exact times. 

Data Gaps: 

The following dates and times listed below are gaps in the dataset when no observations were recorded. When there were missing observations for all the sensors, the data time stamp was missing from the file. During the data gaps for EXO2 and the EXO3 sondes listed below, the sensors were removed or not recording for more than 20 minutes. 

For all sensors (these times are not listed in the data frame): 2021-07-02 14:00:00 - 2021-07-02 14:50:00; 2022-04-05 12:00:00 - 2022-04-05 14:00:00; 2022-04-20 13:00:00 - 2022-04-20 13:40:00; 2022-04-20 14:00:00 - 2022-04-20 15:00:00; 2022-05-12 10:00:00 - 2022-05-12 10:30:00; 2022-09-29 14:00:00 - 2022-09-29 15:00:00; 2022-10-17 17:30:00 - 2022-10-17 18:10:00; 2023-08-08 12:20:00 - 2023-08-14 11:30:00; 2023-08-19 04:20:00 - 2023-08-21 09:30:00.  

The EXO2 data at ~1.5m (these times are most likely in the data file but are NAs and flagged as a 7 for observation not recorded): 2021-07-02 13:40:00 - 2021-07-14 10:10:00; 2021-07-28 11:50:00 - 2021-08-19 09:00:00; 2021-11-18 23:10:00 - 2021-11-23 09:20:00; 2022-12-12 13:20:00 – 2023-03-13 14:55:00.

The EXO3 data at 9m (these times are most likely in the data file but are NAs and flagged as a 7 for observation not recorded): 2021-09-23 10:30:00 - 2021-09-27 8:30:00; 2022-01-14 00:00:00 - 2022-01-26 17:00:00; 2022-01-26 17:10:00 - 2022-04-20 15:10:00; 2022-12-12 13:20:00 - 2022-12-16 14:20:00; 2023-11-20 12:05:00 - current. 

Sensor Maintenance Issues: 

Thermistor Issues:

The data from the thermistors and other sensors were influenced by nightly management interventions between 3 am (EST) - 4:30 am (EST). On most nights, there were slight changes in water temperature values caused by blow-offs of air from water intake valves used to clear debris from intake pipes. This release of air can lead to short-term changes in thermal stratification patterns. These events seem to only affect the temperature values at 3:00 am or 4:30 am and occur predominantly in the summer months. 

EXO Sonde Issues:

In 2023, the 1.5 m EXO2 was returned to the reservoir after maintenance on 2023-03-13 14:50:00. The EXO2 experienced issues with the battery compartment and was not streaming data from 2023-07-14 10:10:00 - 2023-10-16 14:00:00. During the times data were not streaming, they were downloaded periodically and added to the file using the CCRCatwalk_qaqc_2021_2023.R. The EXO2 was removed on 16 October 2023 and sent back for maintenance and replaced with a backup EXO2 (SN: 23J102731, other sensors listed below). The 9 m EXO3 sonde experienced wiper issues, so when data were impacted by the wiper they were removed using the CCRCatwalk_maintenancelog_2021_2023.csv. The EXO3 was removed and sent back for major repairs on 20 November 2023 12:05:00 after the battery compartment flooded. 

In 2022, both of the EXOs were removed for cleaning and calibration on 12 December 2022. The EXO3 was returned on 16 December 2022 while the EXO2 was moved and placed at Beaverdam Reservoir for the winter.  
The central wiper (SN: 21A100323) on the EXO3 malfunctioned during September 2021, thus we removed all observations from 7 September 2021 15:30 to 27 September 2021 8:30. While the central wiper was sent back for maintenance, we took the central wiper (SN: 21A100324) from the EXO2 at 1.5 m and installed it on the EXO3 at 9 m. This left the EXO2 at 1.5 m without a central wiper, so we cleaned and downloaded data fortnightly to monthly until we installed a new wiper (SN: 21M102801) on the EXO2 on 9 February 2022 10:30.  The central wiper (21A100324) on the EXO3 failed again, so we removed data from 14 January - 26 January 2022 due to interference in the readings from the wiper. We returned the EXO3 and the sonde for maintenance since this was the second wiper that failed. On 20 April 2022, we redeployed the EXO3 with a new wiper (SN: 22B106313). These wiper issues were all documented in the maintenance log CCRCatwalk_maintenancelog_2021_2022.csv.

EXO Chlorophyll-a and Phycocyanin Issues: 
When the EXO2 was not streaming data, it only recorded chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin in RFU and not micrograms per liter (µg/L). Once the EXO2 data were streaming again, there were observations in both RFU and micrograms per liter. To fill in the gaps for µg/L data, we back-calculated the missing observations for micrograms per liter using a linear relationship of RFU to micrograms per liter. For chlorophyll, the relationship was µg/L = 4*RFU -0.63 and for phycocyanin it was µg/L=1*RFU-0.59. These calculated values were flagged with a 6 (corrected with a linear relationship).

QAQC scripts:

We used a QAQC function to remove maintenance times and outliers from the data before publishing this EDI data package. The function is included in the data package as an R script, CCRCatwalk_qaqc_2021_2023.R. In this function, we flag and remove observations that took place during sensor maintenance or when a sensor malfunctioned, when the sensors were out of place, and when there were extreme outliers. 
For removing and flagging maintenance issues, all maintenance is recorded in the maintenance log (CCRCatwalk_maintenancelog_2021_2023.csv). This file is used in the QAQC function to identify dates and times during recorded events, change the observations affected, and add a flag to indicate the issues. See CCRCatwalk_maintenancelog_2021_2023.csv section below for more information on the maintenance log. 

In addition to recorded maintenance issues, we also removed all observations from the EXOs when they are out of position. For example, the EXO2 normally is positioned at 1.5 m, so when the depth of the sensor was above 0.75 m, we set all of those EXO2 observations to NA and flagged those times with a 2 (for outlier set to NA). This routinely happened for one observation per day, when the Water Authority purged their intake pipes. This also happened in Aug - Sept. 2023 because the water level was lowered due to maintenance at the reservoir. The EXO3 normally sits at 9 m, so when it is above 6 m, the data are changed to NA and flagged with a 2 (for outlier set to NA). In the past, this happened when the sensor was tangled on debris (especially floating logs). 

Lastly, we identified and removed extreme outliers by using what we call the leading and lagging method. For each observation, we looked at the previous observations, taken 10 minutes before, and the lagging observation, taken 10 minutes after the focal observation. If the observation was 2 standard deviations above or below either of those two points, then the observation was flagged and set to NA.  For EXOChla_ugL, EXOChla_RFU, EXOBGAPC_RFU, and EXOBGAPC_ugL, we defined outliers as values 4 standard deviations above or below the focal observation, as opposed to 2 standard deviations for the other sensors, given there is lots of variablility in the observations. 

As part of the QAQC process, we plotted all of the observations in the CCRCatwalk_inspection_2021_2023.Rmd. In the R markdown, the user downloaded data, identified duplicates and  gaps in the data, checked that the maintenanc log flagged values, produced plots to visually check for outliers, saved the current data file, and downloaded the maintenance log, qaqc function, and other functions needed for publishing.

##############################################################

Data file CCRCatwalk_maintenancelog_2021_2023.csv contains dates and times when the sensors were above the water's surface for maintenance. Here, we recorded when sensors were cleaned, removed for maintenance, or other issues that should be noted. This file is used in the QAQC function which indexes the dates and times recorded in the maintenance log to set the affected data to NA and/or set the appropriate flags (CCRCatwalk_qaqc_2021_2023.R).  A description of the columns is in the Detailed Metadata under Data Entries. A description of how to use the function is at the top of the CCRCatwalk_qaqc_2021_2023.R script.

CCR_Depth_offsets_2021_2023.csv

The data file CCR_Depth_offsets_2021_2023.csv contains the depth offsets for each position on the temperature string. These offsets are used to calculate the depth of the sensors below the surface of the water. We used this method to ensure we removed observations when the sensors were out of the water or properly removed/flagged observations when sensors moved positions. To do this, we created a function find_depths which can be found in find_depths.R script. This function uses the CCR_Depth_offsets_2021_2023 file and the depth of the pressure sensor to determine the depth of an observation. 

To determine the variable depths of each sensor over time, we converted the pressure readings to depth readings, in meters, using the relationship 1 psi=0.70544 m from the pressure gauge manual (Campbell Scientific CS451, https://s.campbellsci.com/documents/us/manuals/cs451-cs456.pdf). The offset values for positions 1 and 2 were determined to be the depth of the pressure transducer when each thermistor was first at the surface of the water. For thermistor 1, the offset was equal to the depth of the pressure transducer on 25 May 2021 16:50, whereas the offset for thermistor 2 was equal to the depth of the pressure transducer on 30 November 2021 16:20. Since the other sensors were equidistant from each other and the water level was never low enough to expose them out of the water, we subtracted the offset of position 2 from the offset of position 13, which is 17.915 m. We divided that number (17.915) by the number of whole meters below position 2 (18 m), which was equal to 0.995 m. This means sensors we assumed were 1 meter apart are 0.995 meters apart. This number (0.995) was subtracted from the offset of each thermistor to find the subsequent offset of the thermistor in the position below. For example, to find the offset for position 3, we took the offset for position 2 (18.065) and subtracted 0.995 to get 17.07 m, which is the depth reading from the pressure transducer when position 3 is out of the water. The offset for position 13 is the distance of the thermistor from the pressure transducer. 

To calculate the depth below the water for each sensor’s position, first subtract the unique offset for each sensor from column LvlDepth_m_13, which is the depth of the pressure transducer. Below is a table with the position of the sensor, the offset, and the distance above the sediments. 

This only needs to happen for sensors deployed on the temperature sting. The EXO2 at ~1.5 m and the EXO3 at ~9 m have their own pressure transducer/depth sensors, so each of these instruments have their own individually-determined depths associated with each measurement. 


Offset Table:
The offset table is the same as CCR_Depth_offsets_2021_2023.csv.  The table below is the position of the sensor, offset to find the depth of the position from the top of the water at a given time, and the depth of the sensors when the reservoir depth is at full pond. To determine the depth of each position at a given time, you find the depth of the pressure transducer in column LvlDepth_m_13, and subtract the offset for that position. The R function, find_depths.R, attached to this package, will do this for you and sort the depths into columns by the 0.5 meter and variable (Temperature, Dissolved Oxygen, Dissolved oxygen saturation, and Pressure).

Data file CCR_hobos_2020_2021.csv contains measurements of depth profiles of water temperature at Carvins Cove Reservoir from July 2020 - August 2021 using HOBO temperature pendant loggers (HOBO Pendant Temperature/Light Data Logger, Onset, Bourne, MA, USA) at site 50 and site 300 (see reservoir_site_description.csv). We deployed the loggers from a buoy at 1-meter intervals from just below the surface to 10 m depth and additionally at 15 and 20 m depth. After the streaming sensors from CCR_Catwalk_EDI_2021_2022.csv were installed, we removed the Hobo pendants from the reservoir.  We also deployed a HOBO temperature pendant in the Sawmill Branch inflow (site 300) from July 2020 - April 2021 at approximately 0.5 m depth. There were no maintenance or other issues flagged in this data file. The HOBO files were compiled for publication in CCR_hobo_compilation_2020_2021.R. 
The HOBO temperature pendant manual from the manufacturer can be found here: https://www.onsetcomp.com/sites/default/files/resources-documents/9556-M%20UA-002%20Manual.pdf.
