This dataset includes weekly and subweekly methane ebullition and diffusion rates collected from March through November in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 in Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR), a drinking water reservoir owned and managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority and located in Vinton, Virginia, USA. In 2016, ebullition rates were measured at four near-shore sites along a longitudinal gradient in FCR that included four replicate locations within each site, for a total of 16 sites in the reservoir. In 2017, methane emission rates and five different potential environmental driver variables (water temperature, wind speed, pressure, turbulence, primary production) were measured at five longitudinal transects that included four replicate sites per transect, for a total of 20 sites in the reservoir. In 2018, ebullition was measured at the same five longitudinal transects but with two replicate sites per transect, for a total of 10 sites. In 2019, ebullition was only measured at the furthest upstream transect monitored in 2017-2018, with four replicate sites within that transect. The dataset consists of four tables: 1) weekly methane ebullition and diffusion rates and the water depths at each of the 24 unique monitoring sites; 2) 10-minute resolution sediment-water interface and surface water temperatures from 16 sites in 2017; 3) weekly sediment-water interface and surface turbulence at the four transects in 2017; and 4) geographical coordinates of each of the 24 sites in the reservoir.
