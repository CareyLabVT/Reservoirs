This dataset includes weekly and subweekly methane ebullition and diffusion rates collected from March through November in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 in Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR), a drinking water reservoir owned and managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority and located in Vinton, Virginia, USA. In 2016, ebullition rates were measured at four near-shore sites along a longitudinal gradient in FCR that included four replicate locations within each site, for a total of 16 sites in the reservoir. In 2017, methane emission rates and five different potential environmental driver variables (water temperature, wind speed, pressure, turbulence, primary production) were measured at five longitudinal transects that included four replicate sites per transect, for a total of 20 sites in the reservoir. In 2018, ebullition was measured at the same five longitudinal transects but with two replicate sites per transect, for a total of 10 sites. In 2019, ebullition was only measured at the furthest upstream transect monitored in 2017-2018, with four replicate sites within that transect.

Methane monitoring:
We sampled methane ebullition rates using passive ebullition traps that were 0.26-meters squared area (Keller & Stallard, 1994). In 2016, each ebullition trap was deployed 1 meter above the sediments. In 2017-2019, each ebullition trap was placed 0.5 m below the water surface to capture methane bubbles that were released from the sediments underneath the trap. A sealed tube extended from the bottom of the funnel to 0.1 m above the water surface through a foam float that kept the trap in place. The top of the inverted funnel’s tubing was fitted with a 25-mm plastic threaded ball valve that was sealed with a rubber septum stopper (Suba-Seal Septa, MilliporeSigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The valve and the septum prevented ebullition gas from escaping out of the top of the funnel. When rising methane bubbles were caught in the funnel trap, the siphoned water at the top of the tube was displaced with gas, which stayed in the top of the tube until the gas was sampled weekly. We collected ebullition gas from every trap each week during the monitoring period. Up to 10 mL of gas was injected into a 12-mL crimp top glass vial that was pre-filled with salt brine solution. A secondary exit syringe extracted the salt brine solution as the sample was injected to generate 10 mL of gas headspace in the vial. If enough gas sample was available, two replicates were collected from each trap. The vials were stored upside down until analysis, so the remaining 2 mL of salt brine solution acted as a barrier to prevent any gas from escaping. We extracted any remaining gas in the trap using a 30 mL syringe and summed the total volume of gas collected each week. The gas samples were analyzed using a gas chromatograph coupled with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) within 24 hours of collection (following McClure et al., 2018). We calculated the daily ebullition rate separately for each trap every week and then averaged the rates from the four traps within each transect to determine a mean daily transect ebullition rate for each week. 

Methane diffusion rates were collected using the floating chamber method (Galfalk et al., 2013). The chamber was constructed using an inverted opaque bucket with a volume of 0.02 meters cubed and an area of 0.15 meters squared. The trap was fitted with foam so that the lip of the chamber sat approximately 3 cm below the water surface to seal the inside of the chamber from the surrounding air. We prevented internal heating within the chamber while it was deployed by wrapping the outside of the chamber with reflective aluminum tape. Two air-tight gas ports were fitted at the top of the chamber and connected to two separate three-meter sections of 0.635-cm Tygon PVC tubing, which were in turn connected to the inlet and waste valves of a Los Gatos ultraportable GHG analyzer (UGGA; Los Gatos Research Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). The UGGA circulated air through the chamber at approximately 405 mL per minute and recorded moisture-corrected methane (ppm) on 10-second intervals. We allowed the chamber to float freely on the water surface and collect data for five minutes at each site before it was vented to the atmosphere. We used a short incubation time because we were interested in instantaneous diffusion rates and did not intend to parse out ebullition from diffusion. If ebullition bubbles were observed when the chamber was deployed, we removed the chamber from the water surface, held it open to the atmosphere, and waited one minute to allow any methane from the ebullition bubble to circulate out of the chamber before placing it back onto the surface.

Water depth monitoring:
In 2017, 2018, and 2019, the depth of each site was determined using a Portable Water Depth Sounder Gauge (Cole – Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL, USA). We first determined the depth of all the sites. We then determined the mean depth of each transect by adding up the total depth (m) of the traps in each transect and then divided by the number of traps across the transect. 

Water temperature monitoring:
In 2017 and 2018, sediment and surface water temperature data were collected at each ebullition trap during the monitoring period. Two temperature loggers (HOBO Pendant Temperature/Light Data Logger, Bourne, MA, USA) were deployed at each ebullition trap during the monitoring period and recorded data on 10-minute intervals. One logger was sunk using a stainless-steel weight and a nylon string to sit approximately 10 cm above the sediment-water interface to determine the near-sediment temperature. The surface water temperatures logger was attached to the underside of each trap, just below the water’s surface. In 2019, only sediment water temperature data were collected at each ebullition trap during the monitoring period. Water temperature was not monitored in 2016.

Water turblence:
Sediment and surface water turbulence was estimated as turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) at the transects using a calibrated three-dimensional (3-D) hydrodynamic model (Si3D) in 2017 only. Si3D is a semi-implicit 3-D computational fluid dynamics code that adopts a finite-difference method for numerically solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations for momentum, transport equations for temperature, and equations that relate water temperature to density (Rueda & Schladow, 2003; Rueda & Schladow, 2009). Si3D provides output velocities that are highly resolved over space and time and allows a user to analyze physical processes of lake circulation (Rueda & Schladow, 2003). A detailed description of the Si3D model is provided by Rueda & Schladow (2003). Driver data for Si3D includes shortwave radiation (Watts per meter squared), air temperature (degrees celsius), atmospheric pressure (Pa), relative humidity (percent), cloud cover (percent), and the zonal and meridional wind speeds (meters per second), which were all measured by the meteorological station located on the dam (Carey et al., 2019), and the discharge from the primary inflow into the reservoir (Carey et al., 2018). We developed a three-dimensional numerical grid using 5 m by 5 m by 0.3 m (L by W by H) cells was generated for the entire reservoir based on the bathymetry. The Si3D calibration for was validated by Chen et al. (2017, 2018), who reported good consistency between the field and numerical results for reservoir mixing. The sediment and surface turbulence at each of the sites was determined by running Si3D for one-week intervals at five second timesteps, which generated model output of instantaneous velocity in the x, y, and z-axes for each grid cell. First, we determined the perturbation velocity (in centimeters per second), which is the difference between the instantaneous velocity at each timestep and the mean velocity in all three axes in each grid cell over the week-long time interval (Garratt, 1994). Next, we used the mean perturbation velocities to calculate near-sediment turbulence for each ebullition trap. Finally, we calculated the mean transect-level sediment and surface turbulence by averaging the turbulence for all sites in each transect between weekly samplings.
