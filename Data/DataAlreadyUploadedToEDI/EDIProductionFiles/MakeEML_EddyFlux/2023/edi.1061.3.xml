    <abstract>
      <para>We measured eddy covariance data and fluxes (carbon dioxide, methane) collected at the deepest site of Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA) every 30 minutes from 04 April 2020 to 31 December 2023. Falling Creek Reservoir is a drinking water supply reservoir owned and managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority (WVWA) as a primary drinking water source. The dataset consists of micrometeorological and flux data collected using an eddy covariance system (LiCor Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) and analyzed with associated Eddy Pro software (Eddy Pro Version 7.0.6), including carbon dioxide and methane fluxes. All analysis scripts are included for data processing and quality assurance/quality control following best practices.</para>

          <para>An eddy covariance (EC) system (LiCor Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska) was used to collect greenhouse gas fluxes (carbon dioxide, methane) from Falling Creek Reservoir from 04 April 2020 to 31 December 2023. The EC instrumentation was deployed at the deepest site of Falling Creek Reservoir on a permanent metal platform that extends about 45 m from the dam and approximately 2.9 m over the reservoir's surface (37.30278, -79.83694). The reservoir was maintained at full pond during the monitoring period, resulting in a  negligible change in distance between the EC system and the water's surface. </para>
          <para>###########&#13;
EddyPro Processing and QAQC for EddyFlux_2020_2023.csv</para>
          <para>The EC instrumentation included an ultrasonic anemometer to measure 3D wind speed and direction (CSAT3, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, Utah, USA), an open-path infrared gas analyzer for measuring methane concentration (LI-7700, LiCor Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA), and an enclosed path infrared gas analyzer for measuring carbon dioxide and water vapor concentrations (LI-7200, LiCor Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA). The data streams (anemometer, methane, carbon dioxide, water vapor) were recorded at 10-Hz using a data logger that included a temperature sensor and pressure transducer (LI-7550, LiCor Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA). The open-path methane sensor was manually cleaned approximately weekly from April through October and approximately monthly from November to April. The carbon dioxide sensor was cleaned approximately every three months or when the sensor strength dropped below ~95%.</para>
          <para>The collected, raw 10-Hz data were processed into 30-minute fluxes using the EddyPro v.7.0.6 software (LiCor Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA; LiCor Biosciences 2019) using the 'Express' settings. Following processing in EddyPro software, we excluded some redundant measurements and calculations in R using EddyFlux_qaqc_2020_2023.R. We include the quality control flags for each calculated flux as assigned by EddyPro software such that: 0 = best quality fluxes; 1 = fluxes suitable for general analysis; and 2 = user should remove fluxes following Mauder and Foken (2006). We also added our flags in this column: 3 = flux not recorded; and 4 = instrument malfunction. Flags 3 and 4 were not added by the EddyPro software, but applied in the EddyFlux_qaqc_2020_2023.R script. We added a flag 3 if no observation was recorded while the system was working. Flag 4 was applied when there was an instrument malfunction. This includes removing carbon dioxide and water vapor fluxes when the flow rate from the pump was too low (below 10) or too high (above 20). We also removed extremely high or extremely low fluxes for carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane, defined as carbon dioxide fluxes less than -300 or greater than 300, water vapor fluxes less than -40 or greater than 40, and methane fluxes less than -0.25 or greater than 1. The published file included as part of this data product contains the cleaned data after this QAQC has been applied (EddyFlux_2020_2023.csv). In addition to the EddyFlux_qaqc_2020_2023.R script, we also used the EddyFlux_inspection_2020_2023.Rmd to run the QAQC script for all years of flux data, create plots of the data, write the EddyFlux_2020_2023.csv file, and download additional files for EDI publishing. </para>

          <para>On 10 August 2020, the data logger was removed for maintenance and was re-deployed on 2 September 2020. Additionally, a thermocouple on the CO2 sensor (LI-7500) was inoperable starting on 5 April 2021 and was repaired on 26 April 2021. </para>
          <para>During the late spring and summer of 2022, the head pressure in the LI-7200 Enclosed CO2/H20 gas analyzer sensor was malfunctioning, causing very few recorded CO2 fluxes during this time. On 25 July 2022, we removed and sent back the LI-7200 for maintenance but left the LI-7700 open-path infrared CH4 gas analyzer collecting data at the reservoir. </para>
          <para>We redeployed the LI-7200 on 21 March 2023, but the flow module (LI-7200-1010) was broken, so we did not start collecting carbon dioxide fluxes until 24 April 2023 when it was fixed. The thermocouple on the Ch4 sensor (LI-7700) was replaced on 22 August 2023. </para>

Additional processing script used for cleaning data for publication/analysis: EddyFlux_post_processing.Rmd (NOTE! This additional QAQC script was not applied to the data included in EddyFlux_2020_2023.csv)</para>
          <para>Additional data post-processing following best practices can be applied using the EddyFlux_post_processing.Rmd script, which was not applied on the file EddyFlux_2020_2023.csv but was used by Hounshell et al. (2023) on the 2020-2022 eddy flux data. As detailed in this script, additional data processing options include: 1) removing wind directions which originated behind the dam (i.e., outside of the reservoir; wind direction between 80-250 degrees removed); 2) removing extreme flux values (carbon dioxide fluxes &gt; abs(100) umol C m-2 s-1; methane fluxes &gt; abs(0.25) umol C m-2 s-1); 3) removing methane fluxes when the signal strength &lt;20%; 4) removing carbon dioxide and methane fluxes when they did not pass the test for stationarity or developed turbulent conditions (quality control, QC level 2, per Foken et al. 2004) in addition to when the latent heat flux (LE) or sensible heat (H) had QC level &lt;2; 4) removing open path methane fluxes during periods of rainfall, which was determined based on the rain gauge deployed at the FCR dam; 5) correction for high-pass and low-pass filtering effects (Moncrieff et al. 2004; using the function defined in despike.R), and 6) removing data that corresponded to flux footprints that extended significantly beyond the reservoir. Flux footprints were modeled every half-hour using a simple, two-dimensional parameterization developed by Kljun et al. (2015). This model builds on the Lagrangian stochastic particle dispersion model (Kljun et al., 2002), and provides information on the upwind and crosswind spread of the footprint. All the variables needed for the model were obtained directly from the dataset, or calculated following Kljun et al. (2015). Data were excluded when the along-wind distance providing the highest contribution (peak) to turbulent fluxes was outside the reservoir. Finally, 7) we filtered out additional periods of low turbulence friction velocity (ustar) using REddyProc as described below (Wutzler et al. 2018). </para>
          <para>&#13;
Following 30-minute flux conversions in Eddy Pro and additional post-processing as described above, the EddyFlux_post_processing.Rmd script can also be used for additional data processing using the R package REddyProc (Wutzler et al. 2018) to conduct gap-filling of missing data. First, we used the meteorological data (Carey, Breef-Pilz, and Delany 2024) measured at the dam (located ~45 m from the EC sensors) to gap-fill any missing wind speed, direction, temperature, and relative humidity from the EC data. Second, we calculated the vapor pressure deficit from measured air temperature and relative humidity and calculated net radiation balance from upwelling and downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation. Using REddyProc, we then gap-filled any remaining gaps in the air temperature, shortwave radiation, total PAR, net radiation, sensible heat flux, and latent heat flux using the marginal distribution sampling (MDS) following Wutzler et al. (2018). We then used REddyProc to estimate the ustar threshold distribution and removed any fluxes when the ustar value was too low (Wutzler et al. 2018). Finally, we gap-filled any missing fluxes using the estimated ustar distributions using the MDS method (Wutzler et al. 2018).</para>
