This script is the visual inspection scripts. 

1. QAQCs all the raw data or for a reviewer reads in the data file from EDI for checking. 

2. Then the script checks for duplicates, daily gaps in the file. 

3. Creates plots

4. Writes data to new csv

5. Downloads necessary files for EDI publishing. This file currently does not have a maintenance log


For the plots, they use a function called "all_plot". In all_plot you can specify if you want plotly plots for the current data. BEWARE if you turn on the plotly plots and try to knit the markdown it will fail! I am working on a fix. For right now you can specify which plotly plots you want on. You can also look at the plotly plots manually in each chunk by running the chunk with Use_plotly=TRUE as an argument and then at the end of the chunk output[[1]]. 


All files are from GitHub or EDI and the source scripts are from GitHub as well. 

If you are REVIEWING this data package, add the pasta URL from EDI in the "QAQC file or READ IN EDI FOR REVIEWER". Make sure to comment out the row_bind section and un comment the section that reads in the pasta. In addition, make sure eval=FALSE is in the chunk header for "QAQC raw files", "Make new CSV with current and historic files" chunk and "Download Files". These chunks of code will not be run when the R markdown is knitted together. Once that is all set than you can knit the file together as an HTML document to look at all the plots. 


```{r setup packages, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Load the packages you need
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, lubridate, gsheet, hms,gridExtra,openair, googledrive, knitr, scattermore, htmltools, pander, devtools, plotly)

# Source scripts used in markdown

# Plotting function

#turn off pander auto asis
        pander::panderOptions('knitr.auto.asis', FALSE)

# Set up the current time end time of the file and the current year for QAQC plots

#current time of QAQC for graphing
# The flux system is in Eastern time and observes daylight savings
current_time_start=ymd_hms("2024-01-01 00:00:00", tz= "America/New_York")
current_time_end=ymd_hms("2024-12-31 23:59:00", tz= "America/New_York")
```



```{r QAQC raw files, include=FALSE}
# QAQC the files we have

 current_df <- eddypro_cleaning_function(
   directory = "../../../../DataNotYetUploadedToEDI/EddyFlux_Processing/data/",
    text_file = F,
   gdrive = F, # Are the files on Google Drive. True or False
   gshared_drive = as_id("0ACybYKbCwLRPUk9PVA"),
   output_file = NULL,
   start_date = as.Date("2020-01-01"),
   end_date = as.Date("2024-12-31"))

 # Make a DateTime column but remove it before saving the file
  current_df$DateTime <- ymd_hms(paste0(current_df$date, " " ,current_df$time))

  # force the timezone to Eastern/New_York

  # Set timezone as EST. Streaming sensors don't observe daylight savings
   current_df$DateTime <- force_tz(current_df$DateTime, tzone = "America/New_York")

   # If No EDI file exists with all the years you want to look at
  current_df <- current_df%>%
  dplyr::distinct(.)%>% # get rid of dups if they snuck in
  filter(DateTime<(current_time_end))

# make sure no time duplicates.
 current_df<-  current_df[!duplicated(current_df$DateTime), ]

#reorder. Just to be certain everything is in order
  current_df<-current_df[order(current_df$DateTime),]


```

REVIEWERS- If you are reviewing this data package replace the pasta link with the one from EDI. If there are questions ask the data point person. 

```{r READ IN EDI FOR REVIEWER, include=FALSE}

# For REVIEWERS: Run this section to pull the data from EDI which is in staging as a check of the data.
# MAKE SURE TO UPDATE THE PASTA FROM THE VERSION YOU WANT

                                                                  ### CHANGE THIS NUMBER BELOW 
                                                                               ##      
current_df <-read_csv("https://pasta-s.lternet.edu/package/data/eml/edi/692/14/311d766dd7275d578699380f8996f089")
 #
 # # Force files from EDI to have an EST timestamp

 # Make a DateTime column but remove it before saving the file
 current_df$DateTime <- ymd_hms(paste0(current_df$date, " " ,current_df$time))

  # Set timezone as EST. Streaming sensors don't observe daylight savings
  current_df$DateTime <- force_tz(current_df$DateTime, tzone = "America/New_York")

```


## Check for duplicates and  gaps in the data frame

This section identifies if there are any duplicates, and daily gaps in the long-term record. If there are duplicates. Look to see if they are true duplicates and then check the qaqc function and the chunk above where duplicates should be removed. 


### Are there any duplicates?


```{r Check for dups , echo=FALSE}

# Make sure there are no duplicated dates. Do this here because the file is too large for Data Explore.
# Print them if there are
 dups<- current_df[duplicated(current_df$DateTime), ]

dups <- dups%>%
  select(DateTime, co2_flux_umolm2s,  specific_humidity_kgkg, u_star_ms)

# Make it into a nice table when the Markdown is knitted together
knitr::kable((dups))
```


### Are there any gaps in the data file?


When gaps are found in the data file, check that you do not have new gaps in the previous years' publication. For the current year, if you find gaps check that you have all of the manually downloaded files. If the data are truly missing then record the dates and times in the methods section. 

```{r Check for daily gaps, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#Detect rows with all NAs except the qc and datetime columns
rows_with_all_NAs_except <- current_df %>%
  filter(rowSums(is.na(select(., -qc_Tau, -qc_H, -qc_LE, -qc_co2_flux, -qc_h2o_flux,   -qc_ch4_flux, -date, -time, -DOY, -DateTime))) != ncol(select(., -qc_Tau, -qc_H, -qc_LE, -qc_co2_flux, -qc_h2o_flux,   -qc_ch4_flux, -date, -time, -DOY, -DateTime)))

current_df <- rows_with_all_NAs_except

# Get DOY
df2 <- current_df
 df2$DOY=yday(df2$DateTime)

for(i in 2:nrow(df2)){ #this identifies if there are any data gaps in the long-term record, and where they are by record number
   if(df2$DOY[i]-df2$DOY[i-1]>1){
     print(c(df2$DateTime[i-1],df2$DateTime[i]))
   }
}

```

## QAQC Plots

##### QAQC plot information and all_plot function information

For the plots, they use a function called "all_plot". In all_plot you can specify if you want plotly plots for the current data. If you run this script chunk by chunk, the current year plots using plotly will NOT be generated. To see the plots, uncomment the code and then output[[1]]. For right now you can specify which plotly plots you want on. You can also look at the plotly plots manually in each chunk by running the chunk with Use_plotly=TRUE as an argument and then at the end of the chunk output[[1]]. 

The plotting function is called all_plot() which plots the 4 or more plots described below. The function is sourced from GitHub in the first chunk of the script. The arguments are:
Var, # the variable you would like to plot
data, # the data frame to use
raw_data=NULL, # Is there raw data to compare with. Usually is NULL
reservoir, # the name of the reservoir you would like to filter by 
res_site, # the reservoir Site or Sites you would like to filter by
y_lab,  # This label can take an expression aka have the proper degrees C, 
y_lab2, # This label is for the plotly function which can not handle expression argument. 
Depth=F,  # Do you want depth as a factor
Water=T, # Are these plots for streaming sensors with RDO and temperature sensors
Use_plotly = F, # Do you want to produce interactive plots for observations of the current year?
Heatmap = F) # Do you want to make a heat maps? This only works if there are multiple depths at the same site

The arguments with = followed by a True means that they are the defaults and you don't need to add them to the function when you use it. If you want to use the opposite of the default you must specify that. 
  
##### Plot Description:

The plots below are:
The first 2 plots are the ones you should focus on for the QAQC check. Spend the most time looking at the most recent data because that one has not been checked. Do pay attention to the historical to make sure there are no crazy outliers that were missed in previous years. 

1. A time series of the current years' data. The black dots are the qaqced observations and the red is the raw files that were qaqced. This is to see what kind of values were removed and if there are any the script missed or that need to be added to the maintenance log. 

2. A time series of the historical and the current data just the qaqced values. 

The next two plots are just fun to see trends over time with the data. 

3. Density plots are like a histogram and a grouped by color so you can see where the data are relative to other years. 

4. The box plots look at the spread of the data within the year and we can look at the median and see how that is changing or not. 

Do not over think the last 2 plots. 

### Flux Plots for CO2, H2O, and CH4

```{r Fluxes, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}

dx <- colnames(current_df%>%select(co2_flux_umolm2s, h2o_flux_umolm2s, ch4_flux_umolm2s))

# make the plots
outputs <- lapply(dx, all_plot,data=current_df, raw_data=NULL, reservoir=NULL, res_site =NULL, y_lab="umolm2s", y_lab2="umolm2s",Depth=F, Water=F, Use_plotly=T, Heatmap=F)

output <- unlist(outputs, recursive = F)

# output[[1]]
```

```{r Print plotly fluxes, echo=FALSE, messages=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

 # Used to print the plotly plots
  # attach the Dependencies
  # since the do not get included with renderTags(...)$html
  deps <- lapply(
    Filter(function(x){inherits(x,"htmlwidget")},output),
    function(hw){
      renderTags(hw)$dependencies
    }
  )
  
  if(length(deps)>0){
  attachDependencies(
    tagList(),
    unlist(deps,recursive=FALSE)
  )
  }  
```


### Compare 30 minute flux to daily flux

This is a similar figure to the one in Alex's paper. The 30 minute fluxes are black dotes and the line is the average daily flux

#### CO2

```{r CO2 Thirty Minute to Daily fluxes, echo=FALSE}
daily <- current_df%>% 
  group_by( Date = as.Date(DateTime)) %>%

         Month = month(Date),
         Time = "12:00:00")%>%
  mutate(DateTime= paste0(Date, Time, sep=" "))%>%
  mutate(DateTime=ymd_hms(DateTime)) 

# current daily average 
a <- daily %>%
  filter(DateTime>current_time_start)

# current file
current <- current_df %>%
  filter(DateTime>current_time_start & DateTime<current_time_end)


  ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=current, aes(x= DateTime, y= co2_flux_umolm2s*60*60*24*44.01/1e6),alpha = 0.1)+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype="dashed")+
  geom_line(data = a, aes(x=DateTime, y=co2_flux_umolm2s*60*60*24*44.01/1e6),color="#E63946", linewidth = 1)+
  theme_classic(base_size = 15)+
  xlab("DateTime") + ylab(expression(~CO[2]~flux~(g~m^-2~d^-1))) +
  ggtitle("Current Year Thirty Minute Fluxes to Daily Fluxes")

  ggtitle("Thirty Minute Fluxes to Daily Fluxes")

```

#### CH4 

```{r CH4 Thirty Minute to Daily fluxes, echo=FALSE}

ggplot()+
  geom_point(data = current, aes(x= DateTime, y= ch4_flux_umolm2s),alpha = 0.1)+

  ggtitle("Current Year Thirty Minute Fluxes to Daily Fluxes")


ggplot()+
  geom_point(data = current_df, aes(x= DateTime, y=ch4_flux_umolm2s*60*60*24*16.04/1e6),alpha = 0.1)+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype="dashed")+

### Wind Rose plots for the Current Year and All Observations

Plot the wind direction, see what it looks like. 

```{r Wind Rose, echo=FALSE}

# Visualize wind directions for just the current year 
      chicago_wind <- current%>%
        select(DateTime,wind_speed_ms,wind_dir)%>%
