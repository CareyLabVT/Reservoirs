We measured carbon dioxide and methane flux exchange with the atmosphere at the deepest site of Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA) every 30 minutes from 04 April 2020 to 31 December 2025. Falling Creek Reservoir is a drinking water supply reservoir owned and managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority (WVWA) as a primary drinking water source. The dataset consists of micrometeorological and flux data collected using an eddy covariance system (LiCor Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) and analyzed with associated Eddy Pro software (Eddy Pro Version 7.0.6), including carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor. All analysis scripts are included for data processing and quality assurance/quality control following best practices.
