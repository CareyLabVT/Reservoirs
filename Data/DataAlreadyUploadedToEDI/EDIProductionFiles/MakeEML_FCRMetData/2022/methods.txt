Meteorological data were collected from 2015 through 2022 using a research-grade meteorological station from Campbell Scientific (Logan, UT, USA). Data were collected at 1 minute intervals, except for a brief period at the beginning of the dataset from 2015-07-07 16:45:00 to 2015-07-13 12:20:00 (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss), when data were recorded at 5-minute intervals. To correct for the difference in time interval of data collection, we divided the Rain_Total_mm variable by 5 minutes to get a rate of precipitation in millimeters per minute so that the precipitation data are comparable throughout the dataset; values that were changed in July 2015 were given a “flag 4” in the dataset. The time was changed on 2019-04-15 10:19 so all observations are recorded in the GMT -5 time zone (Eastern Standard time) without any time zone changes in the data record. Time was corrected in the FCR_MET_QAQC_2015_2022.Rmd script so all observations in the FCR_Met_final_2015_2022.csv file are in Eastern Standard Time. 

Site and Power Descriptions:
The Met station is deployed on the shore of Falling Creek Reservoir (37.3025, -79.83667). The meteorological station is powered with a solar panel and lead acid battery. Using a regulator, the solar panel charges the battery, and the battery powers the CR3000 datalogger.

Data Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) procedures: 

Missing data: 
Major gaps lasting longer than 1 day in the record occurred during these intervals: 2016-10-14 16:08:00 to 2016-12-19 15:21:00, 2017-02-06 10:05:00 to 2017-04-24 14:48:00, and 2018-03-19 11:05:00 to 2018-04-05 12:25:00. Sub-daily gaps occurred on 2015-07-13, 2016-07-25, 2016-10-14, 2017-10-09, 2018-05-21, 2018-09-24, 2019-02-08, 2019-04-22, 2021-02-08, 2021-08-17, 2022-04-05, 2022-06-27, 2022-07-05, and 2022-07-15.

Maintenance Log:
We automated QA/QC with an R script (archived with this dataset) that set flags and removed outliers. Smaller gaps in data for a few hours or less due to maintenance occurred throughout the dataset. We set erroneous values due to maintenance as NA (flag 1) in the dataset. For all flag descriptions, see the data table metadata below. There is only one flag per an observation in some cases; flag 1 for maintenance overwrote other existing flags. All previously existing NAs due to missing observations other than maintenance were flagged as 2. Negative values were set to 0 for all meteorological variable columns, except AirTemp_C_Average and variables inside the data logger (Record, CR3000Battery_V,and CR3000Panel_Temp_C), and flagged as 3. Two other variables were flagged as 3: if the relative humidity was over 100%, it was set to 100% and if infrared radiation was recorded as an infinite value, it was set to NA. Outliers or obvious problems with the sensor were changed to NA and flagged as 4, while potentially questionable values that were left in the dataset were flagged as 5. 

Air Temperature and Relative Humidity:
The AirTemp_Average_C variable received intensive QA/QC due to fouling of the sensor filter. After the first year of deployment and before replacement of the sensor filter in February 2019, the air temperature sensor exhibited more outliers than expected. We used the data from the initial year of deployment prior to fouling (2015) to develop a linear relationship to predict AirTemp_Average_C from CR3000Panel_temp_C, the Campbell logger panel temperature sensor, which did not exhibit any outliers or evidence of fouling. The 2015 relationship can be described by the following equation: AirTemp_Average_C = 1.627758(±0.004510, 1 SE) + 0.900781(±0.000252)×CR3000Panel_temp_C. This relationship’s adjusted R-squared value was 0.98. The residuals from this equation were: minimum: -7.3922, 1st quartile: -0.6315, median: 0.0244, 3rd quartile: 0.5602, and maximum: 11.0234. If any air temperature values were more than 3 standard deviations above the predictions from the linear model, we removed that value (flag 4) and substituted it with a new value calculated from the panel temperature and the linear equation. Any missing air temperature values were also estimated using this equation. This occurred for 265830 observations during 2015-2022. Given that temperature and relative humidity are measured with the same sensor, we flagged the time period from 2016-01-01 to 2018-09-18 (when the sensor was cleaned) for potentially higher humidity values, but left the observed values in the dataset flagged as 5.

Solar Radiation-Infrared and Shortwave:
Infrared Radiation Up and Down variables were recorded in volts from 2015-07-07 16:45:00 to 2016-07-25 10:12:00. These values were corrected using equations from the manufacturer's manual: 

InfraredRadiationUp_Average_W_m2 = InfraredRadiationUp_Average_W_m2 + 5.67 times 10 to the (-8) times (AirTemp_Average_C+273.15) to the 4th power 

InfraredRadiationDown_Average_W_m2 = 5.67 times 10 to the (-8) times(AirTemp_Average_C + 273.15) to the 4th power

The InfraredRadiationDown_Average_W_m2 variable also received intensive QA/QC due to potential fouling of the sensor in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. From 2018-08-02 to 2018-09-10 and 2019-07-06 to 2019-07-16, the sensor exhibited atypical low values which were alleviated after the sensor was cleaned on 2018-09-10 12:32:00. We used the data from the years before the fouling incident in 2018 (2015-2017) to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the variable by day of the year (1-366). If values were not within 2 standard deviations of the mean on the given day of the year, they were corrected to the equation above (5.67*10^-8(AirTemp_Average_C+273.15)^4) and flagged with “flag 4”. We also used that equation to replace missing values when no data were recorded, and flagged those data with a 4.

The ShortwaveRadiationUp_Average_W_m2 variable had higher than observed readings in 2018-09-05 12:00 to 2018-09-07 and 2020-05-31 00:00 to 2020-07-10 23:59. The values in 2018 were due to sensor error and fouling as it was right before a cleaning on 2018-09-10. All values during that time were flagged and changed to NA. For the summer values in 2020, outliers were removed according to the outlier value below and values between 1300-1499 W_m2 were flagged for questionable high values with flag 5.

PAR:
PAR data greater than 5 umolm2s for the average and 1 mmol_m2 for the total during the night were changed to NA and Flagged as 4. Daytime hours were determined using the getSunlightTimes function in the Suncalc package in R (Thieurmel, B., Elmarhraoui, A. (2019).suncalc: Compute Sun Position, Sunlight Phases, Moon Position and Lunar Phase. R package version 0.5.0.). From 2019-08-04 to 2019-08-05, 2019-08-15 to 2019-12-13, 2022-03-15 to 2022-04-04, and 2022-05-21 to 2022-07-15, PAR observations were set to NA due to probable sensor failure or fouling as sensor recorded values near 0 for this period. This was also done in 2020 from 2020-07-03 11:56 to 2020-07-21 13:38 from 2020-11-01 12:37 to 2020-11-24 12:32, from 2020-12-01 09:54 to 2020-12-31 23:59. During the summer of 2021 PAR values were higher than normal. From 2021-05-01 00:00 to 2021-07-01 23:59, if PAR_Average_umolm2s was greater than 2500 or PAR _Total_mmol_m2 was greater than 150, the observation was set to NA and flagged with a 4. In the spring of 2022, the PAR sensor was malfunctioning and we removed the sensor on 2022-07-15 13:25:00 and replaced it with the one from Carvins Cove Met station (sensor ID number SN Q112618). After changing sensors, we observed much higher PAR_Total_mmol_m2 values than we normally see after re-examining the program we realized we had used the wrong multiplier. We flagged these observations in the FCR_Met_MaintenanceLog_2015_2022.csv with flag 4 for a corrected value and corrected the values from 2022-07-15 to 2023-01-24 in FCR_MET_QAQC_function_2015_2022.R. 

Outlier Values: 
The outlier thresholds were developed by comparison with the NOAA Roanoke Airport dataset. The Roanoke Airport is located ~10 km away from Falling Creek Reservoir. After previously described adjustments, outliers were set to NA and received a ‘flag 4’ in the dataset, following these outlier thresholds:

AirTemp_C_Average > 40.6; 

InfaredRadiationUp_Average_W_m2 < 150; 

InfaredRadiationDown_Average_W_m2 <200 & >540; 

BP_Average_kPa < 98.5; 

PAR_Total_mmol_m2 > 200; 

ShortwaveRadiationUp_Average_W_m2 > 1500; 

ShortwaveRadiationDown_Average_W_m2 > 300; 

Albedo_Average_W_m2 > 1000; 

Rain_Total_mm>5


All QA/QC code used for the dataset is archived with this dataset. The FCR_Met_QAQC_function_2015_2022.R is a function used for automated QAQC. The function is used in the See FCR_MET_QAQC_Plots_2015_2022.Rmd, which combines the raw data files, runs them through the automated QAQC function and plots each variable to visually inspect for outliers.
