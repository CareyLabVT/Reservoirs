Data Collection Frequency:
Meteorological data were collected from 2015 through 2023 using a research-grade meteorological (Met) station from Campbell Scientific (Logan, UT, USA) on the dam of Falling Creek Reservoir (37.3025 N, -79.836667 W). Data were collected at 1-minute intervals, except for a brief period at the beginning of the dataset from 2015-07-07 16:45:00 to 2015-07-13 12:20:00 (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss), when data were recorded at 5-minute intervals. To correct for the difference in time interval of data collection, we divided the Rain_Total_mm variable by 5 minutes to get a rate of precipitation in millimeters per minute so that the precipitation data is comparable throughout the dataset; values that were changed in July 2015 were given a “flag 4” in the dataset. The time was changed on 2019-04-15 10:19 so all observations are recorded in the GMT -5 time zone (Eastern Standard time) without any time zone changes in the data record. Time was corrected in the FCRMet_qaqc_2023_2023.R script so all observations in the FCRMet_2015_2023.csv file are in Eastern Standard Time. 

Site and Power Descriptions:
The Met station is deployed on the dam of Falling Creek Reservoir (37.3025, -79.83667). The meteorological station is powered with a solar panel and lead acid battery. Using a regulator, the solar panel charges the battery, and the battery powers the CR3000 datalogger.

Data Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) procedures: 

Missing Data: 
Major gaps lasting longer than 1 day in the record occurred during these intervals: 2016-10-14 16:08:00 to 2016-12-19 15:21:00, 2017-02-06 10:05:00 to 2017-04-24 14:48:00, and 2018-03-19 11:05:00 to 2018-04-05 12:25:00. Sub-daily gaps occurred on 2015-07-13, 2016-07-25, 2016-10-14, 2017-10-09, 2018-05-21, 2018-09-24, 2019-02-08, 2019-04-22, 2021-02-08, 2021-08-17, 2022-04-05, 2022-06-27, 2022-07-05, 2022-07-15, 2023-06-26, and 2023-07-19.

Maintenance Log and QAQC:
The Maintenance Log, FCRMet_maintenancelog_2015_2023.csv, is a file in which we record any maintenance on the Met station which needs to be removed from the data file. We also include dates when observations need to be changed or modified because of human error. The maintenance log then removes or flags problematic data using the qaqc_fcrmet function in the FCRMet_qaqc_2023.R script. In addition to removing observations during maintenance, the script also flags and removes values that are outliers. Below, we describe those thresholds and situations. The years on the qaqc function indicate which years are run through the function. In the January 2024 revision of this package, only 2023 was run through the function and then we merged it with the previous years' file on EDI. 

All QA/QC code used for the dataset is archived with this dataset (see FCRMet_qaqc_2023_2023.R). In addition to the qaqc script, we have included a visual inspection script which uses the current files, checks for NAs in the flag columns, runs visual checks to make sure the maintenance log worked properly, creates qaqc plots for visual inspection of the data, creates the newest data file by merging the historical files and the most recent files we are adding this year, and downloads files and scripts to be uploaded with this data package. 


Flag Descriptions:
We set erroneous values due to maintenance as NA (flag 1) in the dataset. For all flag descriptions, see the data table metadata below. There is only one flag per an observation in some cases; flag 1 for maintenance overwrote other existing flags. All previously existing NAs due to missing observations other than maintenance were flagged as 2. Negative values were set to 0 for all meteorological variable columns, except AirTemp_C_Average and variables inside the data logger (Record, CR3000Battery_V,and CR3000Panel_Temp_C), and flagged as 3. Two other variables were flagged as 3: if the relative humidity was over 100%, it was set to 100% and if infrared radiation was recorded as an infinite value, it was set to NA. Outliers or obvious problems with the sensor were changed to NA and flagged as 4, while potentially questionable values that were left in the dataset were flagged as 5. 



Air Temperature and Relative Humidity:
The AirTemp_Average_C variable received intensive QA/QC due to fouling of the sensor filter. After the first year of deployment and before replacement of the sensor filter in February 2019, the air temperature sensor exhibited more outliers than expected. We used the data from the initial year of deployment prior to fouling (2015) to develop a linear relationship to predict AirTemp_Average_C from CR3000Panel_temp_C, the Campbell logger panel temperature sensor, which did not exhibit any outliers or evidence of fouling. The 2015 relationship can be described by the following equation: AirTemp_Average_C = 1.627758(±0.004510, 1 SE) + 0.900781(±0.000252)×CR3000Panel_temp_C. This relationship’s adjusted R-squared value was 0.98. The residuals from this equation were: minimum: -7.3922, 1st quartile: -0.6315, median: 0.0244, 3rd quartile: 0.5602, and maximum: 11.0234. If any air temperature values were more than 3 standard deviations above the predictions from the linear model, we removed that value (flag 4) and substituted it with a new value calculated from the panel temperature and the linear equation. Any missing air temperature values were also estimated using this equation. Given that air temperature and relative humidity are measured with the same sensor, we flagged the time period from 2016-01-01 to 2018-09-18 (when the sensor was cleaned) for potentially higher humidity values, but left the observed values in the dataset flagged as 5.

Solar Radiation- Infrared and Shortwave:
Infrared Radiation Up and Down variables were recorded in volts from 2015-07-07 16:45:00 to 2016-07-25 10:12:00. These values were corrected using equations from the manufacturer's manual: 

InfraredRadiationUp_Average_W_m2 = InfraredRadiationUp_Average_W_m2 + 5.67*10^(-8) times (AirTemp_Average_C+273.15) to the 4th power 

InfraredRadiationDown_Average_W_m2 = 5.67*10^(-8) times(AirTemp_Average_C + 273.15) to the 4th power

The InfraredRadiationDown_Average_W_m2 variable also received intensive QA/QC due to potential fouling of the sensor in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. From 2018-08-02 to 2018-09-10, the sensor exhibited atypically low values which were alleviated after the sensor was cleaned on 2018-09-10 12:32:00. We used the data from the years before the fouling in 2018 (2015-2017) to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the variable by day of the year (1-366), as 2016 was a leap year. This file is FCRMet_Infrad_DOY_Avg_2018.csv, which is saved with the data package. If values were not within 2 standard deviations of the mean on the given day of the year, they were corrected to the equation above (5.67*10^-8(AirTemp_Average_C+273.15)^4) and flagged with “flag 4”. We also used that equation to replace missing values when no data were recorded, and flagged those data with a 4. This happens in the FCRMet_qaqc_2023.R script, which is saved with this package. 

The ShortwaveRadiationUp_Average_W_m2 variable had higher than expected readings in 2018-09-05 12:00 to 2018-09-07 20:00, and 2020-05-31 00:00 to 2020-07-10 23:59. The higher-than-expected values in 2018 were due to sensor error and fouling that occurred before a cleaning on 2018-09-10 11:30. All values during that time were flagged and changed to NA. For the summer values in 2020, outliers were removed according to the outlier thresholds listed below (see Outlier Values section) and values between 1300-1499 W_m2 were flagged for questionable high values with flag 5.

PAR:
PAR data greater than 5 umolm2s (average) and 1 mmol_m2 (total) during the night were changed to NA and flagged as 4. Daytime hours were determined using the getSunlightTimes function in the Suncalc package in R (Thieurmel, B., Elmarhraoui, A. (2019). suncalc: Compute Sun Position, Sunlight Phases, Moon Position and Lunar Phase. R package version 0.5.0.). From 2019-08-04 to 2019-08-05, 2019-08-15 to 2019-12-13, 2022-03-15 to 2022-04-04, and 2022-05-21 to 2022-07-15, PAR observations were set to NA due to probable sensor failure or fouling as sensor recorded values near 0 for this period. This was also done in 2020 from 2020-07-03 11:56 to 2020-07-21 13:38 from 2020-11-01 12:37 to 2020-11-24 12:32, from 2020-12-01 09:54 to 2020-12-31 23:59. During the summer of 2021, PAR values were higher than normal. From 2021-05-01 00:00 to 2021-07-01 23:59, if PAR_Average_umolm2s was greater than 2500 or PAR _Total_mmol_m2 was greater than 150, the observation was set to NA and flagged with a 4. In the spring of 2022, the PAR sensor was malfunctioning and we removed the sensor on 2022-07-15 13:25:00 and replaced it with the one from Carvins Cove Met station (sensor ID number SN Q112618). After changing sensors, we observed much higher PAR_Total_mmol_m2 values than we normally see. After re-examining the program, we realized we had used the wrong multiplier. We flagged these observations in the FCRMet_maintenancelog_2015_2023.csv with flag 4 for a corrected value and corrected the values in FCRMet_qaqc_2023.R. 

Outlier Values: 

The outlier thresholds were developed by comparison with the NOAA Roanoke Airport dataset. The Roanoke Airport is located ~10 km away from Falling Creek Reservoir. After previously described adjustments, outliers were set to NA and received a ‘flag 4’ in the dataset, following these outlier thresholds:

AirTemp_C_Average > 40.6; 
InfaredRadiationUp_Average_W_m2 < 150; 
InfaredRadiationDown_Average_W_m2 <200 & >540; 
BP_Average_kPa < 98.5; 
PAR_Total_mmol_m2 > 200; 
ShortwaveRadiationUp_Average_W_m2 > 1500; 
ShortwaveRadiationDown_Average_W_m2 > 300; 
Albedo_Average_W_m2 > 1000; 
Rain_Total_mm>5
