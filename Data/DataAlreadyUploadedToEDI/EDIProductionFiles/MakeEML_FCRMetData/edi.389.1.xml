    <abstract>
      <para>
  This dataset consists of meteorological variables measured by a
  research-grade Campbell Scientific meteorological station deployed on
  the dam of Falling Creek Reservoir. Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton,
  Virginia, USA), is owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water
  Authority as a primary water source. The meteorological variables
  include photosynthetically active radiation, barometric pressure,
  ambient air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, wind speed and
  direction, shortwave radiation, infrared radiation, and albedo. All
  variables were measured every 5 minutes from 2015-07-07 16:45:00 to
  2015-07-13 12:20:00 (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss) and every minute thereafter
  to the end of the dataset at 2018-12-31 23:59:00. We applied
  substantial substantial quality assurance/quality control protocols to
  the raw observations, as described therein.

  OVERVIEW Meteorological data were collected from 2015 through 2018
  using a research-grade meteorological station from Campbell Scientific
  (Logan, UT, USA). Data were collected at 1 minute intervals, except
  for a brief period at the beginning of the dataset from 2015-07-07
  16:45:00 to 2015-07-13 12:20:00 (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss), when data were
  recorded at 5-minute intervals. All observations are recorded in the
  GMT -5 time zone (Eastern Standard time) without any time zone changes
  in the data record.

  METEOROLOGICAL STATION BATTERY DESCRIPTION: The meteorological station
  is powered with a solar panel and lead acid battery. Using a
  regulator, the solar panel charges the battery, and the battery powers
  the CR3000 datalogger.
</para>
          <para>
  DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC) DESCRIPTION: Missing
  data: Major gaps lasting longer than 1 day in the record occurred
  during these intervals: "2016-10-14 16:08:00" to
  "2016-12-19 15:21:00", "2017-02-06 10:05:00" to
  "2017-04-24 14:48:00", and "2018-03-19 11:05:00"
  to "2018-04-05 12:25:00". Sub-daily gaps occurred on
  "2015-07-13", "2016-07-25",
  "2016-10-14", "2017-02-06",
  "2017-10-09", "2018-03-19",
  "2018-05-21", and "2018-09-24".
</para>
          <para>
  We automated QA/QC with an R script ('Met_QAQC.R,' archived with this
  dataset) that set flags and removed outliers. Smaller gaps in data for
  a few hours or less due to maintenance occurred throughout the
  dataset. We set erroneous values due to maintenance as NA (flag 1) in
  the dataset. For all flag descriptions, see the data table metadata
  below. There is only one flag per variable in the dataset with all
  unique flag values; flag 1 for maintenance in some cases overwrote
  other existing flags. All previously existing NAs due to missing
  observations other than maintenance were flagged as 2 for convenience
  in analysis. Negative values were set to 0 for all meteorological
  variable columns except AirTemp_Average_C and data logger variables.
  Values over 100% were set to 100 for Relative Humidity. Infinite
  values were set to NA for all variables and flagged as 3.
</para>
          <para>
  Air Temperature QA/QC: The AirTemp_Average_C variable received more
  intensive QA/QC than other meteorological variables due to fouling of
  the sensor filter. After the first year of deployment, the air
  temperature sensor exhibited more outliers than should be typical. We
  used the data from the initial year of deployment prior to fouling
  (2015) to develop a linear relationship to predict AirTemp_Average_C
  from CR3000Panel_temp_C, the Campbell logger panel temperature sensor,
  which did not exhibit any outliers or evidence of fouling. The 2015
  relationship can be described by the following equation:
  AirTemp_Average_C = 1.627758(plus or minus 0.004510, 1 SE) +
  0.900781(plus or minus 0.000252)times CR3000Panel_temp_C This
  relationship's adjusted R-squared value was 0.98. The residuals from
  this equation were minimum: -7.3922, 1st quartile: -0.6315, median:
  0.0244, 3rd quartile: 0.5602, and maximum: 11.0234. If any air
  temperature values were above the upper 3 standard deviations of the
  residuals from the linear model, we removed that value (flag 4) and
  substituted it with a new value calculated from the panel temperature
  and the linear equation. This occurred for 174728 observations. Given
  that temperature and relative humidity are measured with the same
  sensor, we flagged the time period after 2015 for potentially higher
  humidity values but left the observed values in the dataset.
</para>
          <para>
  Infrared Radiation Upwelling and Downwelling QA/QC: Infrared Radiation
  Up and Down variables were recorded in volts from 2015-07-07 16:45:00
  to 2016-07-25 10:55:00. These values were corrected using equations
  from the manufacturer's manual: InfaredRadiationUp_Average_W_m2 =
  InfaredRadiationUp_Average_W_m2+5.67 times 10 to the (-8) times
  (AirTemp_Average_C+273.15) to the 4th power
  InfaredRadiationDown_Average_W_m2 = 5.67 times 10 to the
  (-8)times(AirTemp_Average_C+273.15)to the 4th power The
  InfaredRadiationDown_Average_W_m2 variable also received more
  intensive QA/QC than other meteorological variables due to potential
  fouling of the sensor in 2018. From 2018-08-02 to 2018-09-10, the
  sensor exhibited atypical low values which were alleviated after the
  sensor was cleaned on 2018-09-10 12:32:00. We used the data from the
  years before the fouling incident in 2018 (2015-2017) to calculate the
  mean and standard deviation of the variable by day of the year
  (1-366). If values were not within 3 standard deviations of the mean
  on a given day of the year, they were corrected to the mean for that
  day and flagged.
</para>
          <para>
  Other Outliers: After previously described adjustments, outliers were
  set to NA and received 'flag 4' in the dataset, following these
  outlier thresholds: InfaredRadiationUp_Average_W_m2 &amp;lt; 150
  BP_Average_kPa &amp;lt; 95 PAR_Total_mmol_m2 &amp;gt; 200
  ShortwaveRadiationUp_Average_W_m2 &amp;gt; 2000
  ShortwaveRadiationDown_Average_W_m2 &amp;gt; 300 Albedo_Average_W_m2 &amp;gt;
  1000 RH_percent &amp;gt; 100 The outlier thresholds were developed by
  comparison with the NOAA Roanoke Airport dataset and the
  meteorological maintenance log, which was also archived with this
  dataset ('Met_Maintenance_2015_2018.csv.zip'). The Roanoke Airport is
  located ~10 km away from Falling Creek Reservoir.
</para>
          <para>
  As noted above all QA/QC R code (see 'Met_QAQC.R') used for the
  dataset is archived with this dataset.
