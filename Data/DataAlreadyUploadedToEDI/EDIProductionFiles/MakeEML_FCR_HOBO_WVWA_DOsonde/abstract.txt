We measured water temperature and dissolved oxygen at multiple depths in Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA) with high-frequency (10 to 15-minute) sensors for different durations during 2012 to 2018. Falling Creek Reservoir is owned and managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority as a primary drinking water source for Roanoke, Virginia. All measurements were collected at discrete depths at the deepest site of the reservoir adjacent to the dam. The sensors consisted of: 1) InsiteIG dissolved oxygen and water temperature sensors (Model 20 dissolved oxygen sensor) at both 1 m (November 2015 - December 2018) and 8 m (September 2012 - December 2018) and 2) HOBO (HOBO Pendant Temperature/Light 64K Data Logger) water temperature loggers deployed at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.3 m depths (September 2015 - January 2018).
