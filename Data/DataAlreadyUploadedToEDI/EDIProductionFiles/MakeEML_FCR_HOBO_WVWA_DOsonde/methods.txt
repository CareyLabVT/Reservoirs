Multiple sensors were deployed at Falling Creek Reservoir during the monitoring period.

First, dissolved oxygen and water temperature was measured every 15 minutes at 1 m and 8 m depths at Falling Creek Reservoir’s (FCR) deepest site (site 50; latitude: 37.303, longitude -79.837) near the dam using Insite Instrumentation Group Model 20 dissolved oxygen sensors (Manufacturer's specification sheet: https://www.insiteig.com/20/20pdfs/Model-20-Data-Sheet.pdf). The 8 m sensor was deployed on 28 September 2012 and the 1 m sensor was deployed on 9 November 2015. Both sensors were used to collect data through 31 December 2018.  

QAQC was applied to these two DO sonde data for values when sensors were out of the water column for cleaning and for extreme outliers. Extreme outliers were identified via three separate steps: the first was identifying times when sensor malfunctions had clearly occurred and were identified by DO mg/L values over 1000. Both DO and temperature measurements for these intervals were set to NA and assigned a flag of 2 (i.e., a negative or outlier value). After this first step, a second step of QAQC was applied in which outliers were identified as values that were >=2 standard deviations above or below the previous observation and the past observation. These values were also flagged with a 2. Flags of 7 (missing observations, set to NA) were applied as a third QAQC step.

Water temperature was collected every 10 to 15 minutes at approximately one-meter intervals from 1 m to 9.3 m depth using HOBO Pendant Temperature data loggers at Falling Creek Reservoir’s deepest site (site 50; https://www.onsetcomp.com/products/data-loggers/ua-002-64). The depth of the temperature loggers varied slightly year to year for different research project needs but included these depths: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.3 m. Temperature loggers were initially deployed on 28 September 2015 and removed on 15 January 2018.
