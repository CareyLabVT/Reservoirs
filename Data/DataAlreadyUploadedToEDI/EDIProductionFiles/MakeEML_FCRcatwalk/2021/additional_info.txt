Author Contribution Statement-
The first author is the lead and corresponding author to ensure the long-term maintenance, continuity, and integrity of EDI data products over time. -Cayelan C. Carey
The second authors served as the "data product lead" on that data product citation for that particular year's DOI revision . This includes collating the data, editing the QAQC scripts and producing the final data product. -Adrienne Breef-Pilz
The next set of authors (listed in reverse chronological order) includes the primary point people on that dataset over time. -Whitney M. Woelmer,
The last group of authors (listed alphabetically) includes the collaborators that contributed in other ways to the data product to merit co-authorship that year.To merit co-authorship in this second group, the collaborators need to contribute in at least two roles, which include (but are not limited to!): substantial fieldwork throughout the field season for the routine monitoring data collection (e.g., sampling at the reservoirs most weeks in the summer and contributing in the fall/winter/spring as able); leading sensor/instrument maintenance/deployment; leading field crew; initiating new data streams; leading QAQC; maintaining data wireless transmission and connectivity; in-lab chemical or microscopic analyses; and data analyses (including substantial digitization and processing).-

In 2018-2021, hypolimnetic oxygenation water quality management occurred in Falling Creek Reservoir. For a detailed description of the hypolimnetic oxygenation engineered system, see Gerling et al. (2014). This system was operated intermittently from April to November 2018 and again in 2019, 2020 and 2021.
