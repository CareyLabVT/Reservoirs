Depth profiles of water temperature on 1m intervals from 0.1 to 9 m depth; dissolved oxygen at 5 and 9 m depth; pressure at 9 m depth; and temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, specific conductance, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, total dissolved solids, fluorescent dissolved organic matter, and pressure  at ~1.6 m depth were collected with a suite of high-frequency sensors at Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA) on the 10-minute scale in 2018-2022. Falling Creek Reservoir is owned and managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority as a primary drinking water source for Roanoke, Virginia. This data product consists of one dataset compiled from water temperature data measured at multiple depths by thermistors, two dissolved oxygen sensors at multiple depths, pressure measured at one depth, and a YSI EXO2 sonde that measures temperature, dissolved oxygen, pressure, conductivity, specific conductance, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, total dissolved solids, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter, at one depth, all measured at the deepest site of the reservoir adjacent to the dam.
