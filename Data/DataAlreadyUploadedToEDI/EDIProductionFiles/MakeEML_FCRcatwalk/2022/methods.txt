Methods:
Data from multiple water quality sensors were collected from a fixed platform at the deep hole of Falling Creek Reservoir (located at 37.30325,	-79.8373 and referred to as Site F50) in 2018-2022. Data were collected using water temperature thermistors, dissolved oxygen sensors, pressure sensors, and a YSI EXO2 sonde. Profiles were collected every ten minutes from July 2018 to December 2022. We deployed the thermistors and 5 and 9 m dissolved oxygen sensors in July 2018 and the EXO2 sonde at 1 m depth was deployed in August 2018. The EXO2 sonde was moved from 1.0 m to 1.6 m depth on 2019-05-20 at 12:40:00 (1.6 m is the depth of one of the outtake valves for drinking water treatment). As the EXO2 sonde has been moored near the outtake valve at 1.6 m (assuming full pond), the exact depth of the EXO2 sonde varied slightly over time due to small water level changes in the reservoir. We deployed a pressure transducer at 9 m in May 2020 to help track water level changes. 

At the time of deployment in summer 2018, the thermistor string was factory-calibrated and verified against a NIST-traceable thermistor to meet measurement precision. The in situ dissolved oxygen sensors were calibrated using a one point calibration according to the standards and practices outlined in the user manual. The YSI EXO2 Sonde sensors, except for temperature, were user-calibrated as outlined in the user manual and KOR EXO software. 
The reservoir has an oxygenation system that has been manipulated for whole ecosystem experiments throughout the deployment of the sensors. This results in various oxygen conditions over time. Because of this, different levels of QAQC are done to the sensors but especially the dissolved oxygen sensors at 5m and 9m. See Additional Info for more information about oxygenation regimes. 

Maintenance/Issues
All maintenance, calibration times and sensor issues are recorded in the FCR_CAT_MaintenanceLog_2018_2022.txt. The text below explains the issues and how they were dealt with in the data. 

Maintenance data gaps:
The sensor string was regularly brought up to the surface for routine maintenance, dates and times of which were recorded in the FCR_CAT_MaintenanceLog_2018_2022.txt file. To account for this, we used an automated QAQC script (FCR_catwalk_QAQC_function_2018_2022.R) which indexed the dates and times recorded in the maintenance log and set the data to NA and the other Flag columns to 1. Any data points outside of the immediate time frame that the sensor string was up that do not reflect ambient conditions due to sensor re-equilibration were also set to NA in the corresponding Flag column.

Dissolved Oxygen sondes at 5 and 9 m:
Maintenance performed on the sensors-
When the oxygenation system is first activated, we have observed a rapid fouling of the 9m Do probe, which we typically flag with a 5 (questionable value due to potential fouling) or 6 (very questionable value due to potential fouling. Values adjusted using a linear or square root function to match high-resolution CTD profiles are given in RDO_mgL_5 and RDO_sat_percent_5), based on comparison with other sensors.

2021-
At 9m there were some high oxygen readings on 2021-06-07-2021-06-08 about 3 hours after the temperature string had been pulled up. There was no oxygen at 9m, as the oxygenation system had not been turned on yet,  so these readings were changed to NA and flagged. 
The oxygenation was first turned on 11 June at 9:40EST but we were having issues with the oxygen regulator so we were unsure how well the system was working until the regulator was fixed and deployed on 14 September 2021 at 13:30 EST. During this time we have flagged the data with a flag of 5 because of the fluctuations from the system. 
The temperature string was tangled after some maintenance on June 18th, 2021 at 10:00 and was fixed on June 21, 2021 at 10:00. It was tangled again on July 21st, 2021 13:20 and fixed on July 26th, 2021 at 12:00. Consequently, there was a data gap for both DO sensors with a data flag of 1 in the Flag_All column and individual flag columns of the sensors affected. The 9m RDO-PRO_X sensor was calibrated on August 18th, 2021 with a two point calibration using 100 percent air saturation and a 0 percent saturation with a sodium sulfite solution. On August 24, 2021, the anti-fouling caps on the RDO-PRO-X sensors were removed as they were causing fouling especially in anoxic hypolimnion. The RDO-PRO-X sensor cap at 5m was replaced on August 31st, 2021 and checked with a 100 percent air saturation and 0 percent saturation.

2020-On August 7, 2020, the RDO-PRO-X Sensor caps at 5 m and 9 m were replaced. Both dissolved oxygen sensors were calibrated on August 17, 2020 using a one point 100 percent air saturation calibration. 

QAQC methods: After any maintenance on the DO sensors, DO measurements for the next two hours are changed to NAs to give ample time for the sensors to equilibrate. There were two periods in the summer of 2019 and four periods in the summer of 2020 when hypolimnetic DO sondes gave low readings that did not align with simultaneous measurements from a high-resolution CTD profiler (likely due to fouling). We adjusted these values using linear or square root functions to best match the CTD and present those data in a separate column (original values are retained and data are flagged for this column with Flag = 6). The equations for each adjustment are given below, as well as in the R code provided with this data product.

Water temperature (thermistors)
2022: 
The temperature was tangled from May 23-25, 2022 and again from August 8-9, 2022. See FCR_CAT_MaintenanceLog_2018_2022.txt for exact times. Data for the thermistors, RDO sensors and pressure sensor were removed and flagged with 1. 

2021:
Thermistors at 1m(SN 3724) and 4m(SN 3747) were reading higher than normal (See below late October-December 2020) and were removed on January 7, 2021 14:30 and replaced on February 26, 2021 12:00 with SN 3966 and SN 4013. No data was recorded at those depths and was flagged for those sensors affected.  

The temperature string was tangled after some maintenance on June 18th, 2021 at 10:00 and was fixed on June 21, 2021 at 10:00. It was tangled again on July 21st, 2021 13:20 and fixed on July 26th, 2021 at 12:00. Consequently, there was a data gap for all the temperature sensors with a data flag of 1 for those sensors affected.  
 
2020:
The temperature string was tangled after some maintenance on October 9th, 2020 and was fixed on October 11, 2020. Consequently, there was a data gap for the temperature sensors at 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 m from October 9-11, 2020, with a data flag of 1 for those sensors affected. 

On October 19, 2020, the NexSens T-Node FR Thermistor (Serial No. 3718) deployed at 0.1 m stopped working and read NA until October 20, when we took the thermistor from 2 m and put it at 0.1 m. There was a data gap at 2m from October 20-22, 2020. We put the NexSens T-Node Thermistor (Serial No. 3903) from Beaverdam Reservoir, another one of our sites, at 0.1 m in FCR and returned the 2 m thermistor back to its original depth at  2 m on October 22, 2020. Consequently, there was a data gap for 0.1 m temperature from October 19-20, 2020 and a data gap for 2 m temperature from October 20-22, 2020, all flagged with data code 1 .

In late October-December 2020, two of the Nexus T-Node FR Thermistors (at 1 m and 4 m) appeared to be reading water temperatures higher than the sensors deployed above them. On 7 Jan 2021, we put the 2 suspect thermistors and 4 other thermistors adjacently located (0.1, 2, 3, and 9 m) in a water bath in the field for an hour. The water bath showed that thermistors at 1 m and 4m were exhibiting higher readings than the others in the bath. The 1 m thermistor was reading about 0.2496℃ higher, and the 4 m thermistor was reading about 0.3862℃. To correct for this discrepancy, we created an offset for both the 1 m and 4 m thermistors from November 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 (the time period in which the thermistors were consistently exhibiting higher temperature readings). First, we took the average temperature of the thermistors directly above and below the suspect ones for each 10-min interval observation during November 1 to December 31, 2020. Second, we calculated the difference between the suspect thermistor’s reading and its neighbor average, which we averaged over the entire time period to calculate a mean offset. Third, this mean offset was subtracted from the observed thermistor reading on each observation. For example, for the 1 m thermistor we took the average of the 0.1 m thermistor and the 2m thermistor for the neighbor average at each time interval, then we found the difference between the 1 m thermistor and the neighbor average to calculate the offset value for the entire November 1-December 31 period. The offset value for the 1 m thermistor was 0.22617oC and for the 4m thermistor was 0.18122oC. The offset was subtracted from the 1 m thermistor values from October 29, 2020 13:00EST to the end of 2020 and the offset for the 4m thermistor was subtracted from the raw values on October 31, 2020 05:00EST to the end of 2020.  These times were chosen because the broken thermistors were reading consistently higher than the one above them. The observations that received an offset were flagged with data code 8.

Pressure Transducer at 9 m:
The temperature string was tangled after some maintenance on June 18th, 2021 at 10:00 and was fixed on June 21, 2021 at 10:00. It was tangled again on July 21st, 2021 13:20 and fixed on July 26th, 2021 at 12:00. Consequently, there was a data gap for data from the pressure transducer with a data flag of 1 for all sensors that were affected. 



EXO Chlorophyll-a and Phycocyanin QAQC
The chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin sensor data underwent a QAQC process to remove extreme outliers (see ‘Leading and Lagging QAQC’ section of FCR_catwalk_QAQC_function_2018_2022.R script). Outliers were defined as absolute values greater than four standard deviations from previous and subsequent measurements for each individual observation. These outliers were set to NA and identified in the Flag_Chla or Flag_Phyco column as a value of 2. In October 1st, 2018- March 3rd, 2019 outliers were identified as the absolute values greater than four standard deviations from the average measurement. These outliers were set to NA and flagged as 4 in the Flag_Chla or Flag_Phyo. After March 3rd, 2019 outlier values identified this what were left in the dataset and flagged as 5 for questionable value. 

EXO fDOM QAQC
fDOM sensor data underwent a QAQC process to remove extreme outliers (see ‘Leading and Lagging QAQC’ section of FCR_catwalk_QAQC_function_2018_2022.R script). Outliers were defined as absolute values greater than two standard deviations from previous and subsequent measurements for each individual observation. These outliers were set to NA and identified in the Flag_fDOM column as a value of 2.   

EXO Conductivity, specific conductance, and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS):
Conductivity, specific conductance, and TDS sensor data underwent a QAQC process to remove extreme outliers (see ‘Leading and Lagging QAQC’ section of FCR_catwalk_QAQC_function_2018_2022.R script). Outliers were defined as absolute values greater than two standard deviations from previous and subsequent measurements for each individual observation. These outliers were set to NA and identified in the Flag_fDOM column as a value of 2. During the summer of 2020 there were some high conductivity events. Any value above 42 microsiemens for conductivity, conductivity, specific conductivity and TDS were flagged as 5 (questionable value) but not removed from the data set. 

All other observations went through the same extreme QAQC processing for extreme outliers (see ‘Leading and Lagging QAQC’ section of FCR_catwalk_QAQC_function_2018_2022.R script). 

EXO sonde
2022 Maintenance:
On March 17, June 27, and December 15, 2022, the dissolved oxygen sensor was calibrated. The dissolved oxygen sensor was calibrated with a one point 100 percent air saturation for March and June (DO Gain 1.10) with a 2 point calibration in December (DO Gain 1.23). A turbidiy sensor was added on May 2, 2022. See section Instruments, manual, and serial numbers for more information. On December 12 2022, the EXO sonde from FCR was removed to be sent in for calibration and replaced with the EXO sonde from BVR. 

2021 Maintenance:
On March 22, 2021, the dissolved oxygen sensor and depth sensor were calibrated. The dissolved oxygen sensor was calibrated with a one point 100 percent air saturation. On April 16, 2021, the fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM) sensor was calibrated with a one point calibration in DI water or a 0 point calibration. The chlorophyll sensor was checked with DI water but was not calibrated. Due to a bad calibration of the fDOM sensor it was recalibrated on April 26, 2021 and all data were set to NA during that time. On June 15, 2021 a one point 100 percent air saturation calibration was done on the dissolved oxygen sensor. On August 16, 2021 a two point calibration was done on the dissolved oxygen sensor with 100 percent air saturation and a 0 percent calibration.  On December 13, 2021 the EXO was brought in the lab for a deep clean, o ring maintenance, and zero calibration check of chlorophyll and fDOm and redeployed the next day. 


2020 Maintenance:
On August 7, 2020, the YSI EXO (1.6 m) Optical Dissolved Oxygen Sensor Cap (Serial No. 20E101629) was replaced, and the dissolved oxygen sensor was calibrated on August 17, 2020 using a one point 100 percent air saturation calibration. The EXO 1.6 m dissolved oxygen sensor was recalibrated on 15 September 2020, 19 October 2020, and 27 December 2020 using a one point 100 percent air saturation calibration.

The YSI EXO sonde was removed from the reservoir on December 2, 2020 for manufacturer cleaning, maintenance, and calibration. It was re-deployed in the reservoir on December 27, 2020. Below is the status of each sensor: pass or fail, and the calibration, or maintenance  information. All sensors were calibrated by the manufacturer on December 21, 2020 unless otherwise stated.
