DESCRIPTION OF DATASET AND ASSOCIATED SCRIPTS:

Data from multiple water quality sensors were collected from a fixed platform at the deep hole of Falling Creek Reservoir (located at 37.30325, -79.8373 and referred to as Site 50) in 2018-2023. Data were collected using water temperature thermistors, dissolved oxygen sensors, pressure sensors, and a YSI EXO2 sonde. Profiles were recorded every ten minutes from 05 July 2018 to 31 December 2023. We deployed the thermistors and 5 and 9 m dissolved oxygen sensors in 05 July 2018 and the EXO2 sonde at 1 m depth was deployed in August 2018. The EXO2 sonde was moved from 1.0 m to 1.6 m depth on 2019-05-20 at 12:40:00 (1.6 m is the depth of one of the outtake valves for drinking water treatment). As the EXO2 sonde has been moored near the outtake valve at 1.6 m (assuming full pond), the exact depth of the EXO2 sonde varied slightly over time due to small water level changes in the reservoir. We deployed a pressure transducer at 9 m in May 2020 to help track water level changes.


This data package includes 1 data file (FCRCatwalk_2018_2023), QAQC R script (FCRCatwalk_qaqc_2018_2023), maintenance log (FCRCatwalk_maintenancelog_2018_2023), visual inspection R script (FCRCatwalk_inspection_2018_2023),  and additional scripts (Plotting_function). The QAQC script removes outliers, and applies the maintenance log to clean the data files included in the package; the visual inspection script provides code for plotting the data files; and the Plotting_function provides the function necessary for the inspection script.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF MAINTENANCE AND ISSUES FOR EACH SENSOR GROUP: 

At the time of deployment in summer 2018, the thermistor string was factory-calibrated and verified against a NIST-traceable thermistor. The in situ dissolved oxygen sensors were calibrated using a one point calibration according to the standards and practices outlined in the user manual. The YSI EXO2 Sonde sensors, except for temperature, were user-calibrated as outlined in the user manual and KOR EXO software. The reservoir has an oxygenation system that has been manipulated for whole ecosystem experiments throughout the deployment of the sensors. This results in various oxygen conditions over time. Because of this, different levels of QAQC are done to the sensors but especially the dissolved oxygen sensors at 5m and 9m. See the end of this section for more information about oxygenation regimes.


Maintenance data gaps: 
The sensor string was regularly brought up to the surface for routine maintenance, dates and times of which were recorded in the FCRCatwalk_maintenancelog_2018_2023.csv file. To account for this, we used an automated QAQC script (FCRCatwalk_qaqc_2018_2023.R) which indexes the dates and times recorded in the maintenance log and sets the data to NA and the corresponding Flag columns to 1. Any data points outside of the immediate time frame that the sensor string was up that do not reflect ambient conditions due to sensor re-equilibration were also set to NA, with corresponding Flags set to 1. After any maintenance on the DO sensors, DO measurements for the next two hours are changed to NAs to give ample time for the sensors to equilibrate. In 2023, we added this for temperature sensor but shortened the equalibration time to 30 minutes as opposed to two hours. We did not go back and change values from 2018-2022 because we already change unequilibrated values to NA in the maintenance log.

Sensor Issues:

Dissolved Oxygen sondes at 5 and 9 m: 
2023: From July 23- 24, the 5m DO sensor was not recording any values. After changing cables, the sensor worked again. From July 23- 28, the 9m DO sensor was not recording any values. After trimming the flying lead wires on the cable, the sensor worked again.


2021: At 9m there were some high oxygen readings on 2021-06-07-2021-06-08 about 3 hours after the temperature string had been pulled up. Handheld sensors show that oxygen was at ~0 mg/L at 9m at this time, so these readings were changed to NA and flagged. The oxygenation system in 2021 was first turned on 11 June at 9:40EST but experienced malfunctions until repairs were finished on 14 September 2021 at 13:30 EST. During this intervening time, we have flagged the data with a flag of 5 because of the fluctuations in oxygen due to intermittent functioning, malfunctioning, and repairs of the system. The temperature string was tangled after some maintenance on June 18th, 2021 at 10:00 and was fixed on June 21, 2021 at 10:00. It was tangled again on July 21st, 2021 13:20 and fixed on July 26th, 2021 at 12:00. Consequently, there was a data gap for both DO sensors with a data flag of 1 for the flag columns of the sensors affected. The 9m RDO-PRO_X sensor was calibrated on August 18th, 2021 with a two point calibration using 100 percent air saturation and a 0 percent saturation with a sodium sulfite solution. On August 24, 2021, the anti-fouling caps on the RDO-PRO-X sensors were removed as they were causing fouling especially in anoxic hypolimnion. The RDO-PRO-X sensor cap at 5m was replaced on August 31st, 2021 and checked with a 100 percent air saturation and 0 percent saturation.



QAQC methods:

Maintenance performed on RDO sensors- 
When the oxygenation system was first activated, we have observed a rapid fouling of the 9m DO probe, which we typically flag with a 5 (questionable value due to potential fouling) or 6 (very questionable value due to potential fouling). Values adjusted using a linear or square root function to match high-resolution CTD profiles are given in RDO_mgL_5_adjusted and RDO_sat_percent_5_adjusted (2019) and RDO_mgL_9_adjusted and RDOsat_percent_9_adjusted (2019 and 2020), based on comparison with other sensors. Adjusted values were flagged and values not adjusted were set to sensor readings (see below for more info). This equation is also in the FCRCatwalk_laintenanceLog_2018_2023.csv adjustment_code column.

5 meter oxygen sonde: This equation will give you the values in the RDO_mgL_5_adjusted and RDOsat_percent_5_adjusted: 2019-08-11 00:00:00 to 2019-08-12 12:40:00

- DO (percent saturation) = DO observed plus the difference between the current time and 2020-08-11 07:00:00 in minutes, divided by 6500/11.3*100, with 11.3/100 being the potential saturation of oxygen in water at 10 degrees C

2020-08-19 20:00:00 to 2020-08-24 10:40:00 - DO (mg/L) = DO observed plus the difference between the current time and 2020-08-19 20:00:00 in minutes, divided by 6500

Water temperature (thermistors):

2022: The temperature was tangled from May 23-25, 2022 and again from August 8-9, 2022. See FCRCatwalk_MaintenanceLog_2018_2023.csv for exact times. Data for the thermistors, RDO sensors and pressure sensor were removed and flagged with 1.

2021: Thermistors at 1m(SN 3724) and 4m(SN 3747) were reading higher than normal (See below late October-December 2020) and were removed on January 7, 2021 14:30 and replaced on February 26, 2021 12:00 with SN 3966 and SN 4013. No data was recorded at those depths and was flagged for those sensors affected.The temperature string was tangled after some maintenance on June 18th, 2021 at 10:00 and was fixed on June 21, 2021 at 10:00. It was tangled again on July 21st, 2021 13:20 and fixed on July 26th, 2021 at 12:00. Consequently, there was a data gap for all the temperature sensors with a data flag of 1 for those sensors affected. 

2020: The temperature string was tangled after some maintenance on October 9th, 2020 and was fixed on October 11, 2020. Consequently, there was a data gap for the temperature sensors at 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 m from October 9-11, 2020, with a data flag of 1 for those sensors affected. On October 19, 2020, the NexSens T-Node FR Thermistor (Serial No. 3718) deployed at 0.1 m stopped working and read NA until October 20, when we took the thermistor from 2 m and put it at 0.1 m. There was a data gap at 2m from October 20-22, 2020. We put the NexSens T-Node Thermistor (Serial No. 3903) from Beaverdam Reservoir, another one of our sites, at 0.1 m in FCR and returned the 2 m thermistor back to its original depth at 2 m on October 22, 2020. Consequently, there was a data gap for 0.1 m temperature from October 19-20, 2020 and a data gap for 2 m temperature from October 20-22, 2020, all flagged with data code 1.

In late October-December 2020, two of the Nexus T-Node FR Thermistors (at 1 m and 4 m) appeared to be reading water temperatures higher than the sensors deployed above them. On 7 Jan 2021, we put the 2 suspect thermistors and 4 other thermistors adjacently located (0.1, 2, 3, and 9 m) in a water bath in the field for an hour. The water bath showed that thermistors at 1 m and 4m were exhibiting higher readings than the others in the bath. The 1 m thermistor was reading about 0.2496℃ higher, and the 4 m thermistor was reading about 0.3862℃. To correct for this discrepancy, we created an offset for both the 1 m and 4 m thermistors from November 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 (the time period in which the thermistors were consistently exhibiting higher temperature readings). First, we took the average temperature of the thermistors directly above and below the suspect ones for each 10-min interval observation during November 1 to December 31, 2020. Second, we calculated the difference between the suspect thermistor’s reading and its neighbor average, which we averaged over the entire time period to calculate a mean offset. Third, this mean offset was subtracted from the observed thermistor reading on each observation. For example, for the 1 m thermistor we took the average of the 0.1 m thermistor and the 2m thermistor for the neighbor average at each time interval, then we found the difference between the 1 m thermistor and the neighbor average to calculate the offset value for the entire November 1-December 31 period. The offset value for the 1 m thermistor was 0.22617℃  and for the 4m thermistor was 0.18122℃ . The offset was subtracted from the 1 m thermistor values from October 29, 2020 13:00EST to the end of 2020 and the offset for the 4m thermistor was subtracted from the raw values on October 31, 2020 05:00EST to the end of 2020. These times were chosen because the broken thermistors were reading consistently higher than the one above them. The observations that received an offset were flagged with data code 8.

Pressure Transducer at 9 m:
2021: The temperature string was tangled after some maintenance on June 18th, 2021 at 10:00 and was fixed on June 21, 2021 at 10:00. It was tangled again on July 21st, 2021 13:20 and fixed on July 26th, 2021 at 12:00. Consequently, there were data gaps for data from the pressure transducer with a data flag of 1 for all sensors that were affected.

EXO Chlorophyll-a and Phycocyanin QAQC:
The chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin sensor data underwent a QAQC process to remove extreme outliers (see ‘Leading and Lagging QAQC’ section of FCRCatwalk_qaqc_2018_2023.R script). Outliers were defined as absolute values greater than four standard deviations from previous and subsequent measurements for each individual observation. These outliers were set to NA and with a 2  in their respecive columns. In October 1st, 2018- March 3rd, 2019 outliers were identified as the absolute values greater than four standard deviations from the average measurement. These outliers were set to NA and flagged as 4 for fouled sensor. After March 3rd, 2019 outlier values identified this what were left in the dataset and flagged as 5 for questionable value."

EXO fDOM:
The fDOM sensor data underwent a QAQC process to remove extreme outliers (see ‘Leading and Lagging QAQC’ section of FCRCatwalk_qaqc_2018_2023.R script). Outliers were defined as absolute values greater than two standard deviations from previous and subsequent measurements for each individual observation. These outliers were set to NA and identified in the Flag_fDOM column as a value of 2.

EXO Conductivity, specific conductance, and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS): 
Conductivity, specific conductance, and TDS sensor data underwent a QAQC process to remove extreme outliers (see ‘Leading and Lagging QAQC’ section of FCRCatwalk_qaqc_2018_2023.R script). Outliers were defined as absolute values greater than two standard deviations from previous and subsequent measurements for each individual observation. These outliers were set to NA and identified in the Flag_fDOM column as a value of 2. During the summer of 2020 there were some high conductivity events. Any value above 42 microsiemens for conductivity, conductivity, specific conductivity and TDS were flagged as 5 (questionable value) but not removed from the data set.

All other observations went through the same QAQC processing for extreme outliers (see ‘Leading and Lagging QAQC’ section of FCRCatwalk_qaqc_2018_2023.R script).

EXO sonde Maintenance: 

2023: On March 13, the BVR EXO was replaced with the original FCR one which had been sent back for maintenance. The DO sensors was calibrated in 100 percent air saturation (DO Gain 1.09). On July 7, the EXO was disconnected and used for surface sampling while collected data with an ADCP. On August 7, the wiper was replaced with one from BVR (SN: 19G104137) because it could not complete a full wipe. On Oct 3, the program was changed to wipe the sensors every 52 minutes as opposed to every 5 minutes. This was to extend the life of the wiper. We did not notice any fouling or unusually high values after this was implemented. On Dec 12, the DO sensor was calibrated with 100 percent air saturation (DO Gain 1.04).

2022: On March 17, June 27, and December 15, 2022, the dissolved oxygen sensor was calibrated. The dissolved oxygen sensor was calibrated with a one point 100 percent air saturation for March and June (DO Gain 1.10) with a 2 point calibration in December (DO Gain 1.23). A turbidity sensor was added on May 2, 2022. See section Instruments, manual, and serial numbers for more information. On December 12 2022, the EXO sonde from FCR was removed to be sent in for calibration and replaced with the EXO sonde from BVR.

2021: On March 22, 2021, the dissolved oxygen sensor and depth sensor were calibrated. The dissolved oxygen sensor was calibrated with a one point 100 percent air saturation. On April 16, 2021, the fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM) sensor was calibrated with a one point calibration in DI water or a 0 point calibration. The chlorophyll sensor was checked with DI water but was not calibrated. Due to a bad calibration of the fDOM sensor it was recalibrated on April 26, 2021 and all data were set to NA during that time. On June 15, 2021 a one point 100 percent air saturation calibration was done on the dissolved oxygen sensor. On August 16, 2021 a two point calibration was done on the dissolved oxygen sensor with 100 percent air saturation and a 0 percent calibration. On December 13, 2021 the EXO was brought in the lab for a deep clean, o ring maintenance, and zero calibration check of chlorophyll and fDOm and redeployed the next day.

2020: The YSI EXO sonde was removed from the reservoir on December 2, 2020 for manufacturer cleaning, maintenance, and calibration. It was re-deployed in the reservoir on December 27, 2020. On August 7, 2020, the YSI EXO (1.6 m) Optical Dissolved Oxygen Sensor Cap (Serial No. 20E101629) was replaced, and the dissolved oxygen sensor was calibrated on August 17, 2020 using a one point 100 percent air saturation calibration. The EXO 1.6 m dissolved oxygen sensor was recalibrated on 15 September 2020, 19 October 2020, and 27 December 2020 using a one point 100 percent air saturation calibration.
