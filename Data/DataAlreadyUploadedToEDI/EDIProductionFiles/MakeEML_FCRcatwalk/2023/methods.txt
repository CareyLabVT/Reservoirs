DESCRIPTION OF DATASET AND ASSOCIATED SCRIPTS:

Data from multiple water quality sensors were collected from a fixed platform at the deep hole of Falling Creek Reservoir (located at 37.30325, -79.8373 and referred to as Site 50) in 2018-2023. Data were collected using water temperature thermistors, dissolved oxygen sensors, pressure sensors, and a YSI EXO2 sonde. Profiles were recorded every ten minutes from 2018-07-05 to 2023-12-31. We deployed the thermistors and 5 and 9 m dissolved oxygen sensors in 2018-07-05 and the EXO2 sonde at 1 m depth was deployed in August 2018. The EXO2 sonde was moved from 1.0 m to 1.6 m depth on 2019-05-20 at 12:40 (1.6 m is the depth of one of the outtake valves for drinking water treatment). As the EXO2 sonde has been moored near the outtake valve at 1.6 m (assuming full pond), the exact depth of the EXO2 sonde varied over time due to small water level changes in the reservoir and changes in the deployed depth. We deployed a pressure transducer at 9 m in 2020-05-15 to help track water level changes.


This data package includes 1 data file (FCRCatwalk_2018_2023), QAQC R script (FCRCatwalk_qaqc_2018_2023), maintenance log (FCRCatwalk_maintenancelog_2018_2023), visual inspection R script (FCRCatwalk_inspection_2018_2023), and additional scripts (Plotting_function). The QAQC script removes outliers and applies the maintenance log to clean the data files included in the package; the visual inspection script provides code for plotting the data files; and the Plotting_function provides the function necessary for the inspection script.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF MAINTENANCE AND ISSUES FOR EACH SENSOR GROUP: 

At the time of deployment in summer 2018, the thermistor string was factory-calibrated and verified against a NIST-traceable thermistor. The in situ dissolved oxygen sensors were calibrated using a one-point calibration according to the standards and practices outlined in the user manual. The YSI EXO2 Sonde sensors, except for water temperature, were user-calibrated as outlined in the user manual and KOR EXO software. The reservoir has an oxygenation management system that has been used for whole-ecosystem experiments throughout the deployment of the sensors, resulting in various oxygen conditions over time. Because of the operation of the oxygenation system, different levels of QAQC have been applied to the sensors, especially the dissolved oxygen sensors deployed at 5 m and 9 m. See the end of this section for more information about oxygenation system details.


Maintenance data gaps: 
The sensor string was regularly brought up to the surface for routine maintenance, dates and times of which were recorded in the FCRCatwalk_maintenancelog_2018_2023.csv file. To account for these regular cleanings, we used an automated QAQC script (FCRCatwalk_qaqc_2018_2023.R) which indexes the dates and times recorded in the maintenance log and sets the data to NA and the corresponding Flag columns to 1. Any data points outside of the immediate time frame that the sensor string was out of the water that do not reflect ambient conditions (due to sensor re-equilibration after being re-deployed underwater) were also set to NA, with corresponding Flags set to 1. To prevent erroneous data after sensor cleaning, DO measurements for the two hours after any maintenance on the DO sensors were changed to NAs to give ample time for the sensors to equilibrate. In 2023, we applied the same protocol to the temperature sensor but with an equilibration time of 30 minutes as opposed to two hours. We did not go back and change values from 2018-2022 because we already changed unequilibrated values to NA in the maintenance log.

Sensor Issues:

Dissolved Oxygen sondes at 5 and 9 m: 

2023: From 2023-07-23 to 2023-07-24, the 5m DO sensor was not recording any values. After changing cables, the sensor worked again. From 2023-07-23 to 2023-07-28, the 9m DO sensor was not recording any values. After trimming the flying lead wires on the cable, the sensor worked again.

2021: At 9m, there were some high oxygen readings on 2021-06-07 and 2021-06-08 for about 3 hours after the temperature string had been pulled up. Handheld DO sensors show that oxygen was at ~0 mg/L at 9m at this time, so these readings were changed to NA and flagged. The oxygenation system in 2021 was first turned on 2021-06-11 at 9:40 EST but experienced malfunctions until repairs were finished on 2021-09-14 13:30 EST. During this intervening time, we have flagged the data with a flag of 5 because of the fluctuations in oxygen due to intermittent functioning, malfunctioning, and repairs of the oxygenation system. The temperature string was tangled after some maintenance on 2021-06-18 10:00 and was fixed on 2021-06-21 10:00. It was tangled again on 2021-07-21 13:20 and fixed on 2021-07-26 12:00. Consequently, there was a data gap for both DO sensors with a data flag of 1 for the flag columns of the sensors affected. The 9m RDO-PRO_X sensor was calibrated on 2021-08-18 with a two-point calibration using 100 percent air saturation and a 0 percent saturation with a sodium sulfite solution. On 2021-08-24, the anti-fouling caps on the RDO-PRO-X sensors were removed as they were causing fouling especially in anoxic hypolimnion. The RDO-PRO-X sensor cap at 5m was replaced on 2021-08-31 and checked with a 100 percent air saturation and 0 percent saturation.



QAQC methods:

Maintenance performed on RDO sensors- 
When the oxygenation system is activated, we have observed a rapid fouling of the 9m DO probe, which we typically flagged with a 5 (questionable value due to potential fouling) or 6 (very questionable value due to potential fouling). Values adjusted using a linear or square root function to match high-resolution CTD profiles of DO were given in the columns RDO_mgL_5_adjusted and RDO_sat_percent_5_adjusted (2019) and RDO_mgL_9_adjusted and RDOsat_percent_9_adjusted (2019 and 2020), based on comparison with other sensors. Adjusted values were flagged and values not adjusted were set to sensor readings (see below for more info). This equation is also in the FCRCatwalk_MaintenanceLog_2018_2023.csv adjustment_code column.

5 meter oxygen sonde: This equation will give you the values in the RDO_mgL_5_adjusted and RDOsat_percent_5_adjusted: 2019-08-11 00:00 to 2019-08-12 12:40

- DO (percent saturation) = DO observed plus the difference between the current time and 2019-09-02 13:00:00 in minutes, divided by 30000/11.3*100, with 11.3/100 being the potential saturation of oxygen in water at 10 degrees C

2020-08-11 07:00 to 2020-08-17 12:50 - DO (mg/L) = DO observed plus the difference between the current time and 2020-08-11 07:00 in minutes, divided by 6500

- DO (percent saturation) = DO observed plus the difference between the current time and 2020-08-11 07:00 in minutes, divided by 6500/11.3*100, with 11.3/100 being the potential saturation of oxygen in water at 10 degrees C

2020-08-19 20:00 to 2020-08-24 10:40 - DO (mg/L) = DO observed plus the difference between the current time and 2020-08-19 20:00 in minutes, divided by 6500

- DO (percent saturation) = DO observed plus the difference between the current time and 2020-08-19 20:00 in minutes, divided by 6500/11.3*100, with 11.3/100 being the potential saturation of oxygen in water at 10 degrees C

Water temperature (thermistors): note that this section is in reverse chronological order

2022: The temperature was tangled from 2022-05-23 to 2022-05-25 and again from 2022-08-08 to 2022-08-09. See FCRCatwalk_maintenancelog_2018_2023.csv for exact times. Data for the thermistors, RDO sensors, and pressure sensor were removed and flagged with 1.

2021: Thermistors at 1m (SN 3724) and 4m (SN 3747) were reading higher than normal (see the section below regarding late October-December 2020) and were removed on 2021-07-01 14:30 and replaced on 2021-02-26 12:00 with SN 3966 and SN 4013. No data were recorded at 1m or 4m during that time. The temperature string was tangled after some maintenance on 2021-06-18 10:00 and was fixed on 2021-06-21 at 10:00. It was tangled again on 2021-07-21 13:20 and fixed on 2021-07-26 12:00. Consequently, there was a data gap for all the temperature sensors with a data flag of 1 for those sensors affected. 

2020: The temperature string was tangled after some maintenance on 2020-10-09 and was fixed on 2020-10-11. Consequently, there was a data gap for the temperature sensors at 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 m from 2020-10-09 to 2020-10-11, with a data flag of 1 for those sensors affected. On 2020-10-19, the NexSens T-Node FR Thermistor (Serial No. 3718) deployed at 0.1 m stopped working and read NA until 2020-10-20, when we took the thermistor from 2 m and put it at 0.1 m. There was a similar data gap at 2 m from 2020-10-20 to 2020-10-22. We put the NexSens T-Node Thermistor (Serial No. 3903) from Beaverdam Reservoir, another one of our monitoring sites, at 0.1 m in FCR and returned the 2 m thermistor back to its original depth at 2 m on 2020-10-22. Consequently, there was a data gap for 0.1 m temperature from 2020-10-19 to 2020-10-20, and a data gap for 2 m temperature from 2020-10-20 to 2020-10-22, all flagged with data code 1.

In late October-December 2020, two of the Nexus T-Node FR Thermistors (at 1 m and 4 m) appeared to be reading water temperatures higher than the sensors deployed above them. On 2020-01-07, we put the 2 suspect thermistors and 4 other thermistors adjacently located (0.1, 2, 3, and 9 m) in a water bath for an hour. The water bath showed that the thermistors at 1 m and 4m were exhibiting higher readings than the others in the bath. The 1 m thermistor was reading 0.2496℃ higher, and the 4 m thermistor was reading 0.3862℃ higher. To correct for this discrepancy, we created an offset for both the 1 m and 4 m thermistors from 2020-11-01 to 2020-12-31 (the time period in which the thermistors were consistently exhibiting higher temperature readings). First, we took the average temperature of the thermistors directly above and below the suspect ones for each 10-min interval observations during 2020-11-01 to 2020-12-31. Second, we calculated the difference between the suspect thermistor’s reading and its neighbor's average, which we averaged over the entire time period to calculate a mean offset. Third, this mean offset was subtracted from the observed thermistor reading on each observation. For example, for the 1m thermistor, we took the average of the 0.1m thermistor and the 2m thermistor for the neighbor average at each time interval, then we found the difference between the 1m thermistor and the neighbor average to calculate the offset value for the entire 2020-11-01 to 2020-12-31 period. The offset value for the 1m thermistor was 0.22617℃ and for the 4m thermistor was 0.18122℃. The offset was subtracted from the 1m thermistor values from 2020-10-29 13:00 EST to 2020-12-31 23:50 EST and the offset for the 4m thermistor was subtracted from the raw values on 2020-10-31 05:00 EST to 2020-12-31 23:50 EST. These times were chosen because the broken thermistors were reading consistently higher than the one above them. The observations that received an offset were flagged with data code 8.

Pressure Transducer at 9 m: note that this section is in reverse chronological order.

2023: The pressure transducer was moved to replace a broken sensor on 2023-07-10 09:30. We returned it on 2022-07-13 14:00 because we were sampling the bathymetery. The transducer was moved again on 2023-07-17 11:10 and replaced on 2023-09-05 13:30.

2021: The temperature string was tangled after some maintenance on 2021-06-18 10:00 and was fixed on 2021-06-21 10:00. It was tangled again on 2021-07-21 13:20 and fixed on 2021-07-26 12:00. Consequently, there were data gaps for the pressure transducer, which we flagged a 1 for all sensors that were affected during the event.

EXO2 Depth sensor:
The EXO2 sonde we have is vented but the cable is not so the depth reading is not always accuate on the instrument. In order to correct for this we have attempted to moor the sonde at the same level but due to changes in water and deployment practices the sonde is not always exactly 1.6 m below the surface. We try to keep the sonde no more than 3 meter below the surface and if we see that is has slipped then we reposition the sonde. 

EXO2 Chlorophyll-a and Phycocyanin QAQC:

The chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin sensor data underwent a QAQC process to remove extreme outliers (see ‘Leading and Lagging QAQC’ section of FCRCatwalk_qaqc_2018_2023.R script). Outliers were defined as absolute values greater than four standard deviations from previous and subsequent measurements for each individual observation. These outliers were set to NA and with a 2 in their respecive flag columns. In addition, from 2018-10-01 to 2019-03-03, we identified outliers with absolute values greater than four standard deviations from the average measurement. These outliers were set to NA and flagged as 4 for fouled sensor. After 2019-03-03, outlier values identified in this way were left in the dataset and flagged as 5 for being a questionable value.

EXO2 fDOM:

The fDOM sensor data underwent a QAQC process to remove extreme outliers (see ‘Leading and Lagging QAQC’ section of FCRCatwalk_qaqc_2018_2023.R script). Outliers were defined as absolute values greater than two standard deviations from leading or  lagging measurements for each individual observation. These outliers were set to NA and identified in the Flag column as a value of 2.

EXO2 Conductivity, Specific conductance, and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS): 

Conductivity, specific conductance, and TDS sensor data underwent a QAQC process to remove extreme outliers (see ‘Leading and Lagging QAQC’ section of FCRCatwalk_qaqc_2018_2023.R script). Outliers were defined as absolute values greater than two standard deviations from previous and subsequent measurements for each individual observation. These outliers were set to NA and identified in the Flag_fDOM column as a value of 2. During the summer of 2020, there were some high conductivity events. Any value above 42 microsiemens for conductivity, specific conductivity, and TDS were flagged as 5 (questionable value) but not removed from the dataset.

All other observations went through the same QAQC processing for extreme outliers (see ‘Leading and Lagging QAQC’ section of FCRCatwalk_qaqc_2018_2023.R script).

EXO2 Sonde Maintenance: note that this section is in reverse chronological order

2023: On 2023-03-13, the BVR EXO2 was replaced with the original FCR one, which had been sent back for factory calibration and maintenance. The DO sensors were calibrated in 100 percent air saturation (DO Gain 1.09). On 2020-07-07, the EXO2 was disconnected and used for surface sampling while collecting data with an ADCP. On 2023-08-07, the wiper was replaced with one from BVR (SN: 19G104137) because it could not complete a full wipe. On 2023-10-03, the program was changed to wipe the sensors every 52 minutes (as opposed to every 5 minutes) to extend the life of the wiper. We did not notice any fouling or unusually high values after this change was implemented. On 2020-12-12, the DO sensor was calibrated with 100 percent air saturation (DO Gain 1.04).

2022: On 2022-03-17, 2022-06-27, and 2022-12-15, the dissolved oxygen sensor was calibrated. The dissolved oxygen sensor was calibrated with a one-point 100 percent air saturation for 2022-03 and 2022-06 (DO Gain 1.10) with a two-point calibration in December (DO Gain 1.23). A turbidity sensor was added on 2022-05-02. See section Instruments, manual, and serial numbers for more information. On 2022-12-12, the EXO2 sonde from FCR was removed to be sent in for calibration and replaced with the EXO2 sonde from BVR.

2021: On 2021-03-22, the dissolved oxygen sensor and depth sensor were calibrated. The dissolved oxygen sensor was calibrated with a one-point 100 percent air saturation. On 2020-05-16, the fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM) sensor was calibrated with a one-point calibration in DI water or a zero-point calibration. The chlorophyll sensor was checked and cleaned with DI water but was not calibrated. Due to a bad calibration of the fDOM sensor it was recalibrated on 2021-05-26 and all data were set to NA during that time. On 2021-06-15, a one-point 100 percent air saturation calibration was done on the dissolved oxygen sensor. On 2021-08-16, a two-point calibration was done on the dissolved oxygen sensor with 100 percent air saturation and a 0 percent calibration. On 2021-12-13, the EXO was brought in the lab for a deep clean, o-ring maintenance, and zero-point calibration check of chlorophyll and fDOM and redeployed the next day.

2020: The YSI EXO2 sonde was removed from the reservoir on 2020-12-02 for manufacturer cleaning, maintenance, and calibration. It was re-deployed in the reservoir on 2020-12-27. On 2020-08-07, the YSI EXO2 (1.6 m) Optical Dissolved Oxygen Sensor Cap (Serial No. 20E101629) was replaced, and the dissolved oxygen sensor was calibrated on 2020-08-17 using a one-point 100 percent air saturation calibration. The EXO2 1.6 m dissolved oxygen sensor was recalibrated on 2020-09-15, 2020-10-19, and 2020-12-27 using a one-point 100 percent air saturation calibration.
