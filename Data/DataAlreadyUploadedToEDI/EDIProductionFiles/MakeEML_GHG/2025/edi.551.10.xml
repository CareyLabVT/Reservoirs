    <abstract>
      <para>Surface samples and depth profiles of carbon dioxide and methane concentrations were sampled from 2015 to 2025 in three drinking water reservoirs in southwestern Virginia, USA: Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia), Carvins Cove Reservoir (Roanoke, Virginia), and Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia). All three reservoirs are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority as primary or secondary drinking water sources for Roanoke, Virginia. The dataset consists of depth profiles of dissolved greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide, methane) samples measured at the deepest site of each reservoir adjacent to the dam. Additional surface samples were collected at a gauged weir on Falling Creek Reservoir's primary inflow tributary, from a wetland adjacent to Falling Creek Reservoir, and from the reservoir outflow. At Beaverdam Reservoir, additional samples were collected at three outflow sites below the dam and at the mid-reservoir outflow. Samples were collected approximately fortnightly from March-April, weekly from May-October, and monthly in November-February at Falling Creek Reservoir and Beaverdam Reservoir. Samples were collected twice in 2025 at Carvins Cove Reservoir. Additionally, upstream surface samples were taken at multiple tributaries in Carvins Cove Reservoir. In 2019, surface samples along the stream and reservoir continuum in both Falling Creek Reservoir and Beaverdam Reservoir were collected monthly during the summer stratified period. In 2025, littoral samples were collected from Falling Creek Reservoir monthly from June to October (see site descriptions file for geographic coordinates of sampling sites). A maintenance log and quality assurance/quality control analysis scripts accompany the data package.</para>

          <para>SAMPLE COLLECTION AND EQUIPMENT</para>
          <para>1. SAMPLING TIMES </para>
          <para>Sampling times are indicated in the DateTime column, and were collected in the America/New_York Eastern Time Zone, which observed daylight savings time from approximately March to November and Eastern standard time zone in the winter during 2014-2025. All date times are reported in local time (either EST or EDT alternating throughout the year).</para>
          <para>Samples for greenhouse gas (methane, carbon dioxide) analysis were collected from Falling Creek Reservoir, Beaverdam Reservoir, and Carvins Cove Reservoir between 2015 - 2025. Most sampling occurred between the hours of 9:00 and 15:00; however, some sampling occurred outside of these hours, including some overnight sampling. For more information about nighttime sampling, see Doubek et al. (2018) and Wander et al. (2024). Exact sampling times were included in the DateTime column starting in 2018. After 2018, exact times, when recorded during sample collection, are indicated in the DateTime column with a Flag_DateTime value of 0. If exact times were not recorded during sample collection, time was standardized to 12:00 and Flag_DateTime was set to 1. Prior to 2018, sample timestamps for samples collected between approximately 9:00 and 15:00 were standardized to noon and Flag_DateTime was set to 1.</para>
          <para>Samples were collected from several routine monitoring depths at the deepest holes of both reservoirs (Site = 50 in both reservoirs) including: 0.1, 1.6, 3.8, 5.0, 6.2, 8.0, and 9.0 m in Falling Creek Reservoir, 0.1, 3.0, 6.0, 9.0, 10.0 (when the reservoir is deeper than 9.0 m but shallower than 11.0 m) and 11.0 m for Beaverdam Reservoir, and 0.1, 1.5, 6, 9, 20 m in Carvins Cove Reservoir. These sampling depths were chosen to approximately match outtake valves in Falling Creek Reservoir, Beaverdam Reservoir, and Carvins Cove Reservoir. Samples were collected with a 4-L Van Dorn sampler (Wildlife Supply, Yulee, FL, USA) and transferred into two replicate 20-mL glass vials without exposure to air and crimp sealed. All samples were stored on ice and analyzed within 24 hours of collection following McClure et al. (2018). These routine depth samples were collected approximately fortnightly from March-April, weekly from May-October, and monthly in November-February.</para>
          <para>Surface samples from Falling Creek Reservoir were also collected at a gauged weir on the primary inflow (Tunnel Branch) to Falling Creek Reservoir (Site = 100), at the wetland stream (Falling Creek) adjacent to the reservoir (Site = 200), and at the reservoir outflow below the dam (Site = 1.1). In Beaverdam Reservoir, additional surface samples were collected from the several sites at the outflow below the dam (Site = 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4) and at the mid-reservoir Outflow Pipe (Site = 40). In Carvins Cove Reservoir, additional surface samples were collected from the several sites at inflow sites(101, 301). These samples were collected approximately fortnightly from May-October and monthly in November-April, with varying coverage among years.</para>
          <para>In summer 2019, additional surface samples were collected approximately monthly along the stream and reservoir continuum for both Falling Creek Reservoir and Beaverdam Reservoir as part of the Reservoir Continuum project (Falling Creek Reservoir: Creek Sites = 99, 100, 101, 102, 200; Reservoir Sites = 20, 30, 45, 50; Reservoir Outflow = 1 and Beaverdam Reservoir: Creek Sites = 100, 200; Reservoir Sites = 20, 30, 45, 50; Mid-Reservoir Outflow Pipe = 40); see Woelmer et al. (2023) for more information. Surface samples were collected via grab samples for all stream and up-stream reservoir locations.</para>
          <para>In summer 2025, additional samples were collected approximately monthly at nine littoral sites around the perimeter of FCR as part of a macrophyte survey (Littoral Sites = 199.8, 199.9, 10.1, 10.2, 20.1, 20.9, 30.1, 30.9, 45.1). Surface samples were collected via grab samples for all littoral reservoir locations. All samples were stored on ice and analyzed within 24 hours of collection following McClure et al. (2018).</para>
          <para>All sites are described with geographic coordinates in the site_descriptions.csv data file.</para>
          <para>2. SAMPLE ANALYSIS AND EQUIPMENT</para>
          <para>Dissolved methane and carbon dioxide concentrations were measured in each water sample on a Gas Chromatograph (GC) with a Flame Ionization Detector (FID) and Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD) following McClure et al. (2018). From 2015-2018, samples were analyzed on a GC SRI Model 8010. From 2019-onwards, samples were analyzed on a Shimadzu Nexis GC-2030 with AOC-6000 autosampler. Immediately prior to analysis, a 2-mL headspace was created with Helium (He) by displacing 2-mL of sample water.Prior to 2019, the headspace was equilibrated by shaking each 20-mL vial at 300 rpm for 15 minutes. The 2-mL headspace was then injected into the GC. The oven temperature was set to 35 degrees C with a carrier gas (He) flow rate of 15 mL/min. CH4 had a retention time of 1.3 min on the FID and CO2 had a retention time of 2.8 min on the TCD. From 2019-2025, samples equilibrated at room temperature for at least 2 hours before analysis. The autosampler incubated each sample at 40 degrees C while gently agitating for 12 minutes, then injected 0.5 mL of headspace into the GC. The oven temperature was set to 70 degrees C with a carrier gas (He) flow rate of 2.43 mL/min. CH4 had a retention time of 6 minutes on the FID and CO2 had a retention time of 12.2 minutes on the TCD. Dissolved concentrations of CH4 and CO2 in water were calculated using the observed head-space concentrations and Henry's Law (McClure et al. 2018). </para>
          <para>3. DATA FLAGS</para>
          <para>Replicate samples (Rep 1 and 2) were often collected for each date, site, and depth. If a second replicate was not collected, the data were flagged as '1' (sample was not collected). If the analyzed sample had a value below the method detection limit (MDL) the sample was flagged as '2' (sample below MDL). A running MDL was calculated for each GC separately (2015-2018, GC SRI Model 8010; 2019-onwards, Shimadzu Nexis GC-2030) from routinely measured air concentrations throughout the year (2015-2021) or a reference gas tank (2022-2025) and calculated using a consistent temperature (2015-2018 20 degrees C; 2019-2024 40 degrees C) and pressure (30 psi). MDL for each year is presented; 2015 CH4 = 0.001 umol/L, CO2 = 2.13 umol/L; 2016 CH4 = 0.006 umol/L, CO2 = 4.45 umol/L; 2017 CH4 = 0.005 umol/L, CO2 = 12.70 umol/L; 2018 CH4 = 0.005 umol/L, CO2 = 21.84 umol/L; 2019 CH4 = 0.011 umol/L, CO2 = 5.08 umol/L; 2020 CH4 = 0.013 umol/L, CO2 = 6.17 umol/L; 2021 CH4 = 0.021 umol/L, CO2 = 5.74 umol/L; 2022 CH4 = 0.0107 umol/L, CO2 = 3.848 umol/L; 2023 CH4 = 0.0092 umol/L, CO2 = 7.9904 umol/L; 2024 CH4 = 0.0202 umol/L, CO2 = 6.0194 umol/L; 2025 CH4 = 0.0163 umol/L, CO2 = 5.6897.</para>
          <para>Replicates of each sample were assessed after sample analysis using calculated percent difference between replicate samples as well as the limit of quantification (LOQ = 3*MDL). If the difference between replicate samples was &lt; LOQ, then the samples were not flagged ('0', samples are good). If the difference between samples was &gt;LOQ and the percent difference between replicate samples was &lt;30%, then the samples were not flagged ('0', samples are good). If the difference between samples was &gt;LOQ and the percent difference between replicates was &gt;30% but &lt;50%, then the samples were flagged as '3' (difference between reps is above LOQ and above 30% difference and below 50% difference). If the difference between samples was &gt;LOQ and the percent difference between replicates was &gt;50%, then the samples were flagged '4' (difference between replicates is above the LOQ and above 50% different). For all flags, replicates were retained in the dataset. In 2024, we added a new flag of 7, which meant that samples were re-run because of injection error. In brief, moisture interference obscured the CO2 peak for the original injections, so a second injection of these samples was run to obtain usable CO2 data. Despite theoretical differences in headspace conditions between the first and second injections, we found that CO2 values from the second injections were comparable to values obtained from replicate samples. Therefore, for these samples, we include CH4 from the original run and CO2 from the re-run. </para>
          <para>4. DATA PACKAGE UPDATES</para>
          <para>We note several updates to the current data package following multiple revisions of earlier versions of this dataset. First, we now set any negative greenhouse gas values (methane or carbon dioxide) to zero, following best practices. Any samples that had a negative value have been flagged '3'. In addition, we standardized the calculation of MDLs for both methane and carbon dioxide to include a running MDL for all air samples analyzed during each respective year. Importantly, all MDLs are now calculated using a standard temperature (2015-2018 = 20 degrees C; 2019-2025 = 40 degrees C) and pressure (30 PSI).</para>
          <para>
5. WHOLE-ECOSYSTEM EXPERIMENTS</para>
          <para>Multiple whole-ecosystem experiments have been conducted at Falling Creek Reservoir, including intermittent operation of hypolimnetic oxygenation (HOx) and pulsed epilimnetic mixing (EM) engineering systems. We encourage you to contact the lead author of the data package for more information.</para>
