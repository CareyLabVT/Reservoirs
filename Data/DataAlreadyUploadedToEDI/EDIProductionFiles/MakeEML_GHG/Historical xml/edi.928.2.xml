    <abstract>
      <para>Surface samples and depth profiles of carbon dioxide and methane concentrations were sampled from 2015 to May 2022 in two drinking water reservoirs in southwestern Virginia, USA: Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia) and Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia). Both reservoirs are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority as primary or secondary drinking water sources for Roanoke, Virginia. The dataset consists of depth profiles of dissolved greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide, methane) samples measured at the deepest site of each reservoir adjacent to the dam. Additional surface samples were collected at a gauged weir on Falling Creek Reservoir's primary inflow tributary, from a wetland adjacent to Falling Creek Reservoir, and from the reservoir outflow. At Beaverdam Reservoir, additional samples were collected at three outflow points below the dam and at the mid-reservoir outflow. Samples were collected approximately fortnightly from March-April, weekly from May-October, and monthly in November-February at Falling Creek Reservoir and Beaverdam Reservoir. In 2019, surface samples along the stream and reservoir continuum from both Falling Creek Reservoir and Beaverdam Reservoir were collected monthly during the summer stratified period.</para>

      <para>Oxygenation Information:</para>
      <para>From 2015 to 2021, multiple whole-ecosystem manipulations were conducted at Falling Creek Reservoir. These manipulations include intermittent operation of hypolimnetic oxygenation and pulsed epilimnetic mixing engineering systems. For a detailed description of the hypolimnetic oxygenation engineered system, see Gerling et al. (2014) and for a detailed description of the epilimnetic mixing engineered system, see Chen et al. (2017). These systems were operated over time following Table 1 in Gerling et al. (2016), Table 1 in Munger et al. (2016), and Table 2 in McClure et al. (2018). In 2019, the HOx was activated during the following time periods: 29 June to 11 September, 25 September to 02 December. In 2020, the HOx was activated during the following time periods: 29 June to 11 September, 25 September to 02 December. In 2021, the HOx was activated during the following time periods: 11 June to 28 June, 26 July to 6 December 2021.</para>

          <para>SAMPLE COLLECTION AND EQUIPMENT</para>
          <para>Samples for greenhouse gas (methane, carbon dioxide) analysis were collected from Falling Creek Reservoir and Beaverdam Reservoir for 2015 - May 2022 from the deepest site in each reservoir. Most sampling occurred between the hours of 9:00 and 15:00; however, some sampling occurred outside of these hours, including some overnight sampling. For more information about nighttime sampling, see Doubek et. al. 2018. Exact sampling times were included in the DateTime column starting in 2018. After 2018, exact times, when recorded during sample collection, are indicated in the DateTime column with a Flag_DateTime value of 0. If exact times were not recorded during sample collection, time was standardized to 12:00 and Flag_DateTime was set to 1. Prior to 2018, sample timestamps for samples collected between approximately 9:00 and 15:00 were standardized to noon and Flag_DateTime was set to 1.</para>
          <para>Samples were collected from several routine depths including: 0.1, 1.6, 3.8, 5.0, 6.2, 8.0 and 9.0 m in Falling Creek Reservoir and 0.1, 3.0, 6.0, 9.0, and 11.0 m for Beaverdam Reservoir. These sampling depths were chosen to approximately match outtake valves in Falling Creek Reservoir and Beaverdam Reservoir. Samples from Falling Creek Reservoir were also collected from a gauged weir on the primary inflow to Falling Creek Reservoir (Site = 100), as surface samples from the wetlands adjacent to the reservoir (Site = 200), and from the reservoir outflow (Site = 1.1). In Beaverdam Reservoir, additional samples were collected from the several sites at the outflow below the dam (Site = 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4) and at the Mid-Reservoir Ouflow Pipe (Site = 40). In summer 2019, additional surface samples were collected along the stream and reservior continuum for both Falling Creek Reservoir and Beaverdam Reservoir as part of the Reservoir Continuum project (Falling Creek Reservoir: Creek Sites = 102, 101, 100, 99, 200; Reservoir Sites = 20, 30, 45, 50; Reservoir Outflow = 01 and Beaverdam Reservoir: Creek Sites = 100, 200; Reservoir Sites = 20, 30, 45, 50; Mid-Reservoir Outflow Pipe = 40). Routine depth samples were collected approximately fortnightly from March-April, weekly from May-October, and monthly in November-February. Samples were collected with a 4-L Van Dorn sampler (Wildlife Supply, Yulee, FL, USA) and transferred to into two replicate 20 mL glass vials without exposure to air and crimp sealed. Surface samples were collected via grab samples for all stream and up-stream reservoir locations. Samples were stored on ice and analyzed within 24 hours of collection following McClure et al. (2018).</para>
          <para>SAMPLE ANALYSIS AND EQUIPMENT</para>
          <para>Dissolved methane and carbon dioxide concentrations were measured in each water sample on a Gas Chromatograph (GC) with a Flame Ionization Detector (FID) and Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD) following McClure et al. (2018). Briefly, immediately prior to analysis, a 2-mL headspace was created with Helium (He) by displacing 2-mL of sample water. The headspace was equilibrated by shaking each 20-mL vial at 300 rpm for 15 minutes. The 2-mL headspace was then injected into the GC. The oven temperature was set to 35 degrees C with a carrier gas (He) flow rate of 15 mL/min. CH4 had a retention time of 1.3 min on the FID and CO2 had a retention time of 2.8 min on the TCD. Dissolved concentrations of CH4 and CO2 in water were calculated using the observed head-space concentrations and Henry's Law (McClure et al. 2018). From 2015-2018, samples were analyzed on a GC SRI, Model 8010. From 2019-onwards, samples were analyzed on a Shimadzu Nexis GC-2030.</para>
          <para>DATA FLAGS</para>
          <para>Replicate samples (Rep 1 and 2) were often collected for each Date, Site, and Depth. If a second rep was not collected, the data was flagged as '1' (sample was not collected). If the analyzed sample had a value below the minimum detection limit (MDL) the sample was flagged as '2' (sample below MDL). A running MDL was calculated for each GC separately (2015-2018, GC SRI, Model 8010; 2019-onwards, Shimadzu Nexis GC-2030) from routinely measured air concentrations throughout the year and calculated using a consistent temperature (2015-2018 20 deg C; 2019-2022 40 deg C) and pressure (30 psi). MDL for each year is presented; 2015 CH4 = 0.001, CO2 = 2.13; 2016 CH4 = 0.006, CO2 = 4.45; 2017 CH4 = 0.005, CO2 = 12.70; 2018 CH4 = 0.005, CO2 = 21.84; 2019 CH4 = 0.011, CO2 = 5.08; 2020 CH4 = 0.013, CO2 = 6.17 umol/L; 2021 CH4 = 0.021 umol/L, CO2 = 5.74 umol/L; 2022 CH4 = 0.012 umol/L, CO2 = 4.81 umol/L. If the sample had a negative value, the sample value was set to 0 and flagged as '3'. Replicates of each sample were assessed after sample analysis using calculated percent difference between replicate samples as well as the limit of quantification (LOQ = 3*MDL). If the difference between replicate samples was &lt; LOQ, then the samples were not flagged ('0', samples are good). If the difference between samples was &gt;LOQ and the percent difference between replicates samples was &lt;30%, then the samples were not flagged ('0', samples are good). If the difference between samples was &gt;LOQ and the percent difference between replicates was &gt;30% but &lt;50%, then the samples were flagged as '4' (difference between reps is above LOQ and above 30% difference and below 50% difference). If the difference between samples was &gt;LOQ and the percent difference between replciates was &gt;50%, then the samples were flagged '5' (difference between reps is above the LOQ and above 50% different). For all flags, replicates were retained in the dataset.</para>
          <para>DATA PACKAGE UPDATES&#13;
We note several updates to the current data package (EDI 551.7) following previous data packages (EDI 551.6). First, we now set any negative greenhouse gase values (methane or carbon dioxide) to zero, following best practices. Any values that had a negative value have been flagged "3". In addition, we standardized the calculation of MDLs for both methane and carbon dioxide to include a running MDL for all air samples analyzed during each respective year. Importantly, all MDLs were calculated using a standard tempeature (2015-2018 = 20 deg C; 2019-2022 = 40 deg C) and pressure (30 PSI).</para>
