DateTime	"Date of sampling. All data were collected in the eastern time zone of the U.S.A., with daylight savings time observed."	Date		MM/DD/YYYY	NA	value is missing
Depth_m	Depth of sample collection at deepest site (site 50). Additional samples include: 100 = primary inflow to FCR; 200 = wetlands adjacent to FCR; 300 = outflow below dam at BVR	numeric	meter		NA	value is missing
Reservoir	Three-letter code corresponding to sampled reservoir; FCR = Falling Creek Reservoir; BVR = Beaverdam Reservoir	categorical			NA	value is missing
Rep	Replicate sample number. Samples are coded as either 1 or 2.	numeric	dimensionless		NA	value is missing
ch4_umolL	Dissolved methane concentration 	numeric	micromolePerLiter		NA	value is missing
co2_umolL	Dissolved carbon dioxide concentration	numeric	micromolePerLiter		NA	value is missing
flag_ch4	"Flag value for methane concentration; 1 = the percent difference between replicates are <30% and both replicates were retained (i.e., no problems with reps); 2 = The percent difference between replicates was >30% and < 50% (i.e., replicates retained, but were high). Both replicates were retained but flagged; 3 = The percent difference between replicates was >50% (i.e., only one replicate retained). The replicate with the largest difference between replicates collected at depths above and below the sample was removed; 4 = Sample was either not collected or was not retained due to issues with the GC"	numeric	dimensionless		NA	value is missing
