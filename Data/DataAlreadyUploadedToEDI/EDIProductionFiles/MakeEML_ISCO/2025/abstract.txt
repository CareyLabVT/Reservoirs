Metal and nutrient loads were calculated from 2019-2024 from the inflow stream to Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR), a drinking water reservoir located in Vinton, Virginia, USA. The reservoir is owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority and is managed as a secondary drinking-water source for the city of Roanoke, VA. Only Fe, Mn, and nutrients (TN and TP) were analyzed and calculated in 2019. The full suite of metals (Li, Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, Fe, Mn, Cu, Sr, Ba) and nutrients were analyzed from 2020-2024. The loads that were collected using an ISCO automated sampler located at the main inflow tributary to FCR. Sampling frequency was approximately fortnightly from spring to fall (March - November). Load calculations were performed using the calculated cumulative flow over the sampling period from the ISCO and the analyzed total metal and nutrient concentrations. Please note we are publishing this data package befor the nutrient samples have been analyzed, but will be included in later versions.
