ISCO SAMPLING: An automated ISCO sampler was deployed at the weir approximately from April to November in 2019-2023. The ISCO collects flow-proportional composite samples representative of about two-weeks of inflow to FCR. The ISCO has an INW Aquistar PT2x pressure sensor (INW, Kirkland, WA) that measures in 1-minute intervals and is used to calculate discharge using the equation:

V-notch weir discharge equation: Q = 2.391 * H^2.5 

The ISCO is programmed to collect a 200mL sample when 600m3 of flow is calculated to have passed through the V-notch weir. The water samples collect into a 1L bottle stored within the ISCO where they are homogenized over the duration of the sampling period (approximately 2 weeks). For metal collection, samples are poured into 15 mL centrifuge tubes, preserved in the field using 0.5 mL trace metal grade nitric acid to pH less than 2. For nutrient collection, samples were poured into 125 mL acid-washed polypropylene bottles and frozen within 12 hours.


SAMPLING TIMES: Most sampling occurred between the hours of 9:00 and 15:00. Samples were collected in the America/New York Eastern Time Zone, which observed daylight savings time from approximately March to November in 2019-2024.


METAL ANALYSIS: In 2019, samples were analyzed for Fe and Mn using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) using a Spectro ARCOS SOP (Side-On Plasma interface) instrument using methods similar to EPA 200.7 (EPA, 1994). Detection limits for Fe and Mn were 0.004 mg/L and 0.001 mg/L, respectively. Starting in 2020, samples were analyzed for Li, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Fe, Mn, Cu, Sr, and Ba using an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS; Thermo Electron iCAP-RQ) following APHA Standard Method 3125-B (American Public Health Association et al., 1998). Please see the list  at the bottom of the methods for the minimum reporting levels for Fe, Mn, Li, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Cu, Sr, and Ba from 2020-2023. We used the minimum reporting levels as the lower threshold for data in 2020-2023. Values that were below the minimum detection limit (for 2019) or minimum reporting level (for 2020-2023) were flagged as '3' and set to the value of the minimum detection limit or minimum reporting level. Abnormally high concentrations were defined as greater than three standard deviations above the mean, were flagged as '8', and the value was retained. Please see metals data package for more information (https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/b946666bda8e7306c126132146af41c4).

Occasionally, unfiltered samples contain particulates. As particulates cannot be analyzed using ICPMS, samples with particulates were first microwave-digested with concentrated trace metal grade nitric acid (modified from EPA 3015a) prior to analysis and are flagged with a '6'. Please see metals_maintenancelog_2019_2023.csv for more information about specific samples.


NUTRIENT ANALYSIS: Samples were generally analyzed within one year of collection date. Samples were digested with alkaline persulfate (Patton and Kryskalla 2003) and then analyzed colorimetrically using flow injection analysis (APHA 2005).  TN was analyzed using the cadmium reduction method (APHA 1998) and TP was analyzed using the ascorbic acid method (Murphy and Riley 1962) on a Lachat Instruments XYZ Autosampler ASX 520 Series and QuikChem Series 8500 (Lachat ASX 520 Series, Lachat Instruments, Loveland, Colorado, USA).


FLOW CALCULATIONS: The discharge (flow_cms) is calculated using the measured water level (head, m) from the ISCO and the v-notch and rectangular weir equations. Flow overtop the v-notch weir (27.5 cm) is calculated using the v-notch weir equation and the rectangular weir equation using the dimensions of the stream channel. This is an approximate calculation, since flow overtop the v-notch weir is not contained, therefore this is an underestimate of the actual inflow when flow reaches above the 27.5 cm height. These values are flagged with a '2' when more than 10% of the observations during the sampling period were over top the weir. 

V-notch weir, discharge equation: Q = 2.391 x H^2.5

rectangular weir dimensions: B = 0.953 + 1.99 + 1.59

Final equation used - rectangular weir + V-notch weir, discharge equation: 
Q = 2.391 x (0.275^2.5) + (1.84 * B((H-0.275)^1.5)) 

Where Q is the calculated discharge (m^3 s^-1), 2.391 is the conversion factor for a 120 degree angle-notch weir in m^3 s^-1, H is the head on the weir (m), and B is the channel width (m). 

When data is not collected from the pressure transducers, Flag_cumulative_flow_L is set to '1'. Please see discharge data package for more information on calculations and times when data was not collected (https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/65da3369750dbc2933609406e17d4d51). 

Cumulative flow (cum_flow_cms) is recorded for the duration of the sampling period (approximately 2 weeks). It is calculated using the date the ISCO was started and the date when the program stopped collecting water samples. The discharge (flow_cms) for each minute during the sampling period is then added together to get a cumulative flow (cum_flow_cms). Occasionally, the V-notch weir equation calculates greater cumulative flow than the V-notch + rectangular weir equation due to the exponent. For these reasons, we saved only saved higher cum_flow_cms in the final data frame. During the sampling period, occasionally the ISCO stopped working and did not collect the expected number of observations based on the sampling start and end time. Cumulative flow calculations that had more than 60 missing water level observations than expected for the sampling period, were flagged as '4'.

LOAD CALCULATIONS: Loads for each metal and nutrient were calculated using the cumulative discharge (cum_flow_cms) multiplied by the sample concentration collected during the sampling period. Metal load (metal_kg) or nutrient load (nutrient_kg) is representative of the entire sampling period (~2 weeks). We also calculated the loads per day by dividing the loads by the sampling duration minutes to get a load per day for each metal and nutrient (metal_kgd or nutrient_kgd). If a flag was acknowledged for either the concentration or cumulative flow, then the load also received that same flag. 

OTHER FLAG DESCRIPTIONS: If a sample was not taken, then the variable was flagged with a '1'. If a sample was analyzed multiple times, then the values are averaged and flagged as '7'. All flags are either defined in the maintenance log or identified with the QAQC script. Please contact the authors of the data package for more information.
