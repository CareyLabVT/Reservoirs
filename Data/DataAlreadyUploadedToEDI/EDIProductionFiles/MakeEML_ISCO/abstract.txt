Metal and nutrient loads were calculated from 2019-2024 from the inflow stream to Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR), a drinking water reservoir located in Vinton, Virginia, USA. The reservoir is owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority and is managed as a secondary drinking-water source for the city of Roanoke, VA. Only Fe, Mn, and nutrients were analyzed and calculated in 2019. The full suite of metals (Li, Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, Fe, Mn, Cu, Sr, Ba) were analyzed from 2020-2024. The dataset includes total metal loads and nutrient (TN, TP) loads that were collected using an ISCO automated sampler located at the main inflow tributary to FCR. Sampling frequency was approximately fortnightly from spring to fall (March - November). Load calculations were performed using the calculated cumulative flow over the sampling period from the ISCO and the analyzed total metal and nutrient concentrations.
