Discharge rates and water temperature of the primary inflow tributary into Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA) were measured at a gauged weir on a 15-minute temporal resolution from May 2013 to December 2021. Falling Creek Reservoir is a drinking water supply reservoir owned and managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority (WVWA). The dataset consists of water temperatures and discharge rates calculated from a pressure transducer deployed by the WVWA in a rectangular weir (15 May 2013 - 06 June 2019) and in a v-notched weir (07 June 2019 - 22 October 2021) at the same site. From 07 Jun 2019 to 31 December 2021, water temperature and discharge data were also collected from a Virginia Tech-deployed (VT) pressure transducer installed in the same weir.
