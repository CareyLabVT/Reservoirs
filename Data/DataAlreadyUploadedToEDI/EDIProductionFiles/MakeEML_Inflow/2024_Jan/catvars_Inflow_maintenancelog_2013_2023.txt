attributeName	code	definition
DataStream	RATING	Time period for a specifc rating curve
DataStream	WEIR	Maintenance or issues with the weir
Reservoir	FCR	Falling Creek Reservoir
Site	100	Inflow stream of Falling Creek Reservoir
end_parameter	VT_Temp_C	Water temperature measured at the weir entering the reservoir by CS451
end_parameter	WVWA_Flow_cms	Discharge flow rate derived from the WVWA pressure measured at the weir and weir rating curve. For 15 May 2013 - 6 June 2019 (rectangular weir) see Gerling et al. 2014 for equations. For 7 June 2019 - present (v-notch weir), see equations in metadata.
end_parameter	WVWA_Temp_C	Water temperature measured at the weir entering the reservoir by WVWA
flag	1	value corrected to account for artificial increase in pressure after sensor maintenance
