###Data package overview: 

We calculated the daily discharge rate of water in cubic meters per second entering Falling Creek Reservoir through the gauged weir on its primary inflow. This weir was rectangular from 15 May 2013 to 6 June 2019, when it was replaced by a V-notched weir (7 June 2019 to present). Inflow was calculated from a pressure sensor installed at the weir by the Western Virginia Water Authority (WVWA) from 15 May 2013 to 31 December 2024 and a pressure sensor installed by Virginia Tech (VT) researchers (PI Cayelan Carey) from 22 April 2019 to December 2024. Collection of both datasets is ongoing.

We measured discharge at the weir with an INW Aquistar PT2X pressure sensor (INW, Kirkland, Washington, USA) installed by the WVWA on 15 May 2013, which recorded water pressure and stream temperature every 15 minutes. From 22 April 2019 to 31 December 2024, we also measured pressure and stream temperature every 15 minutes using a Campbell Scientific CS451 (Campbell Scientific, Logan, Utah, USA) pressure transducer installed by VT. Observed water level from a staff gauge was recorded weekly to monthly and used to calculate the daily flow, following Gerling et al. (2014) for the rectangular weir (15 May 2013 - 6 June 2019) and the equation below for the v-notch weir (7 June 2019 - December 2024):

V-notch weir, discharge equation:
Q = 2.391 x H^2.5

Where Q is the calculated discharge (m^3 s^-1), 2.391 is the conversion factor for a 120 degree angle-notch weir in m^3 s^-1, and H is the head on the weir (m). We note that for the VT sensor, there was no rating curve developed for the short period of time it was deployed on the rectangular weir (22 Apr 2019 to 6 Jun 2019; before the V-notch weir installation), so VT sensor discharge could not be calculated for this time period, but pressure and temperature are still reported for this interval.

###Description of rating curves over time:

Multiple rating curves have been developed over the time period of this dataset for both pressure sensors. Rating curves were developed using correlations between gauge height and pressure measured for each of the installed pressure sensors (WVWA and VT) and gauge height observations are included as a supplementary dataset, fcre-inflow_gaugeheight_2019_2024.csv. Briefly, the weir level (cm) was intermittently recorded (weekly to monthly). The date and time stamp from each measurement was used to identify the closest pressure reading for both the WVWA and VT pressure sensors. Separate rating curves were developed for the WVWA and VT sensors to convert pressure to gauge height (cm). Gauge height was then converted to (m) and used to calculate discharge as described above. All times below and in the fcre-inflow_gaugeheight_2019_2024.csv data file are in EST without daylight savings observed. 

Rating curves are described below:

1. 6 June 2019 to 24 Aug 2020: Using gauge height measurements taken throughout 10 June 2019 to 6 July 2020, a separate rating curve was developed for the WVWA (gauge height = 63.163 x pressure - 8.7014) and VT (gauge height = 70.640 x pressure - 5.6633) data from 6 June 2019 to 24 Aug 2020.  

2. 24 Aug 2020 to 02 Sep 2020: On 20 Jul 2020, there was a rapid drop in pressure measured at the weir. On 10 Aug 2020, field crew personnel noted the weir had been breached. Thus, both pressure sensors (WVWA and VT) were removed from the weir on 13 Aug 2020 and were re-installed on 24 Aug 2020 after the weir had been fixed. A rating curve was developed for the time period from 24 Aug 2020 to 02 Sep 2020 for both the WVWA (gauge height = 53.191 x pressure - 1.0851) and VT (gauge height = 58.140 x pressure + 2.9302) sensors. 

3. 02 Sep 2020 to 08 Nov 2021: On 02 Sep 2020, the pressure transducers (WVWA and VT) were moved again to prevent sediment burial. Therefore, a third rating curve was developed from 02 Sep 2020 to 08 Nov 2021 for both the WVWA (gauge height = 69.021 x pressure + 0.812) and VT (gauge height = 71.993 x pressure + 5.801) sensors when batteries in the WVWA pressure sensor were replaced. 

4. 08 Nov 2021 to 09 May 2022: Another rating curve was developed from 08 Nov 2021 to 09 May 2022 when the weir was dredged by the WVWA (gauge height = 84.52082 x pressure -6.381252) and VT (gauge height = 84.86239 x pressure + 1.719037).  

5. 09 May 2022 to 05 Jun 2023: Subsequent rating curves were made for the VT sensor from 09 May 2022 to 16 Nov 2022 VT (gauge height = 71.6103 x pressure + 2.413) and 16 Nov 2022 to 01 Apr 2023 (gauge height = 76.02339 x pressure + 1.032). The VT sensor malfunctioned on 01 April 2023. The sensors were moved to inspect the VT sensor on 05 Jun 2023. For the WVWA sensor, a rating curve was developed from 09 May 2022 to 05 Jun 2023 (gauge height = 72.8922 x pressure -5.220). 

6. 05 Jun 2023 to 10 Jul 2023: The sensors were moved on 05 Jun 2023 and again on 10 Jul 2023 to inspect the VT sensor and then to replace it (SN: 29010799). For the VT sensor, there were no observations during this time. For the WVWA sensor, a rating curve was developed (gauge height = 10.5263 x pressure + 7.453).

7. 10 Jul 2023 to 13 Jul 2023: On 13 Jul 2023, the sensors were moved to put the VT sensor at another site to get water level. New rating curves were made: VT (gauge height = 83.333 x pressure -13.833) and WVWA (gauge height = 125.00000 x pressure -25.500)

8. 13 Jul 2023 to 07 Aug 2023: The VT sensor was replaced on 17 Jul 2023 but the WVWA sensor was not affected. Both pressure sensors were moved on 07 Aug 2023 to dredge the weir. Rating curves were made for the VT sensor from 17 Jul 2023 to 07 Aug 2023 (gauge height = 142.85714 x pressure -28.857) and for the WVWA sensor from 13 Jul 2023 to 07 Aug 2023 (gauge height = 76.923 x pressure -16.077).

9. 14 Aug 2023 to 22 April 2024: The sensors were returned to the weir on 14 Aug 2023. The WVWA sensor was in the wrong position and it was fixed on 21 Aug 2023. Rating curves were made for VT (gauge height = 68.256 x pressure -6.836) and WVWA (gauge height = 56.2435 x pressure -0.336) sensors. The WVWA sensor was cleaned out because there was sediment in the pressure sensor causing questionable readings. 

10. 22 April 2024 to current: The sensors were moved after checking and cleaning the sensor. VT sensor (gauge height = 75.5648 x pressure -10.278). WVWA sensor (gauge height = 75.8934 x pressure -30.413).

The rating curve is calculated in the fcre-inflow_qaqc_2013_2024.R script and the time period for each rating curve is in the fcre-inflow_maintenancelog_2013_2024.csv file. As new observations from the gauge height (see fcre-inflow_GaugeHeight_2019_2024.csv) are added, the current rating curve will be updated each year.

VT pressure sensor: 20 Jul 2020 09:45 - 24 Aug 2020 15:00, 06 Nov 2022 09:00 - 19 Nov 2022 06:15, 01 Apr 2023 00:00 - 10 Jul 2023 15:30 due to sensor malfunction, 13 Jul 2023 08:45 - 17 Jul 2023 13:15, 07 Aug 2023 08:45 - 14 Aug 2023 13:00, 05 Sep 2023 15:00 - 12 Sep 2023 13:45, 04 Jan 2024 23:00 - 09 Jan 2024 14:30, 27 Jan 2024 20:00 - 29 Jan 2024 11:30 

On 08 Oct 2024 - 15 Oct 2024, the VT sensor had intermittent power because the batteries that provide power to the data logger were partially disconnected by curious bears. 


High Flow Events: 

The WVWA intermittently opens the pipe that connects the upstream reservoir (Beaverdam Reservoir) with the downstream reservoir (Falling Creek Reservoir), which greatly increases the volume of water that flows through the weir. We have recorded the dates when we can confirm the pipe was opened via communication with the WVWA. 

2021: 20 May - 05 July
2024: 10 December - 31 December 

All other maintenance issues are described in the fcre-inflow_maintenancelog_2013_2024.csv.

A note on using the QAQC files: We created a function to QAQC the observations and calculate flow (fcre-inflow_qaqc_2013_2024.R). This function is used in fcre-inlow_inspection_2013_2024.Rmd, which is an R Markdown file that uses the QAQC function, identifies data gaps, and creates QAQC plots.

### Data Flags

For 15 May 2013 - 6 June 2019, the weir installed at the inflow was rectangular, and thus very low flows were often not well-resolved by our flow equation. At these times, flow is reported as NA. However, the Falling Creek Reservoir inflow stream generally does have perennial flow.

From 08 Nov 2021 to 16 Nov 2022: the VT sensor was about 2.3 cm higher than the WVWA sensor, which resulted in lower estimated flow. We converted cm to psi using the relationship 1 psi = 2.31 ft. from the Campbell Scientific CS451 Manual. So, we added 0.033 psi to all observations from the VT_Pressure_psia observations and flagged these data with a 1 for "value corrected after sensor maintenance or malfunction".

On 22 April 2024, we pulled out both VT and WVWA sensors because we observed suspect readings. The WVWA pressure sensor's pressure sensor was filled with sediment. We cleaned it out and redeployed both the sensors. Because the WVWA_Pressure_psia was compromised, we flagged values from 11 November 2023 to 22 April 2024 as questionable (flag = 9). 

In summer-fall 2024, the WVWA pressure sensor was 1) exhibiting substantially lower values than the VT sensor as well as 2) exhibiting lower pressures than it had been for the same water level historically. The VT sensor was not affected during this time. Because of the lower readings, the rating curve did not capture a high flow event in December 2024 that was observed visually and by the VT sensor. To correct this issue, we created a linear relationship between the pressure readings from the WVWA sensor and the VT sensor. To ensure that we had sufficient high (non-zero readings) for the linear regression, we included data from 22 April 2024 to 30 July 2024, and all of December 2024 to capture the summer low flow and the winter high water flow conditions. The equation was WVWA_Pressure_psia = (VT_Pressure*0.927)+0.279 and is also found in fcre-inflow_maintenancelog_2013_2024.csv. Then we used the corrected values for WVWA_Pressure_psia from 01 July - 10 December 2024. The values were flagged with a 1 for "corrected value". 
 
Flow observations which over-topped the weir (at 27.5 cm) were retained but flagged as 6 in the dataset. Flows below the pressure sensors were set to NA and flagged as 3. We note that measurements with multiple flags are coded as a multiple-digit number (e.g., a flag of '12' indicates there was 1 = value down-corrected to account for artificial increase in pressure after sensor maintenance and 2 = sensor malfunction). No delimiter was added to separate flag codes in those columns.

We added data flags for missing data and when sensors were removed for maintenance (7 and 8, respectively). 

### Notes

All observations are in EST with daylight savings not observed. 

The rating curve script outputs the slope and intercept, along with low observations and high observations for each rating curve (fcre-inflow_ratingcurve_2013_2024.csv). The outputs are updated in this metadata (see Methods section above) each year. 

The Maintenance Log as well as rating curves used over time are published with the dataset so it is easier to find the dates and times of sensor issues, when the sensors were moved, and when the different rating curve equations were implemented (fcre-inflow_maintenancelog_2013_2024.csv). 

Please note: When pulling the file via EDI's API, we recommend using the function "read.csv" instead of "read_csv". The function 'read_csv' identifies the columns for the VT data and associated flags as "logical" instead of "double" due to >100 NA values at the beginning of the dataset. This is avoided when using the function "read.csv".
