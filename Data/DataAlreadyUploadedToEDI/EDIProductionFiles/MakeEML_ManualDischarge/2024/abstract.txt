Discharge rates at multiple inflow streams into Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA), Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA), Carvins Cove Reservoir (Roanoke, Virginia, USA), and one outflow at Falling Creek Reservoir were measured manually using multiple methods from 2019-2024. Falling Creek Reservoir, Beaverdam Reservoir, and Carvins Cove Reservoir are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority as drinking water sources for Roanoke, Virginia. The dataset consists of discharge rates calculated using one of four methods: handheld flowmate, salt injection, velocity float, or bucket method. Data were collected weekly to monthly from February through October 2019 at Falling Creek and Beaverdam Reservoir, and approximately monthly to seasonally at Falling Creek and Carvins Cove from 2020-2024. An additional single data point was collected in 2016 at Falling Creek, but did not form part of an extended data collection.
