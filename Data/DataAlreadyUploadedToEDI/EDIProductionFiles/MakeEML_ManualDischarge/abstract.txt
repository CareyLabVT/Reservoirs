Discharge rates at five inflow streams into Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA) and Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA) were measured manually using multiple methods in 2019. Falling Creek Reservoir and Beaverdam Reservoir are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority as primary and secondary drinking water sources, respectively, for Roanoke, Virginia, and this dataset is used for creating a water budget for the two reservoirs. The dataset consists of discharge rates calculated using one of three methods: propeller flowmate, salt injection, or velocity float method. Data were collected weekly to monthly from February through October 2019.
