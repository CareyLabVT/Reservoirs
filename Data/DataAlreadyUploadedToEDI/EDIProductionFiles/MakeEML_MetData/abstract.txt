This dataset consists of meteorological variables measured by a research-grade Campbell Scientific meteorological station deployed on the dam of Falling Creek Reservoir. Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA), is owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority as a primary water source. The meteorological variables include photosynthetically active radiation, barometric pressure, ambient air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, wind speed and direction, shortwave radiation, infrared radiation, and albedo. All variables were measured every 5 minutes from 2015-07-07 16:45:00 to 2015-07-13 12:20:00 (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss) and every minute thereafter to the end of the dataset at 2020-12-31 23:59:00. We applied substantial quality assurance/quality control protocols to the raw observations, as described therein.
