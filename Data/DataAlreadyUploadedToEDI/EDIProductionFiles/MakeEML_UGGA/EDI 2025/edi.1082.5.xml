    <abstract>
      <para>Diffusive fluxes of methane and carbon dioxide were measured using an Ultraportable Greenhouse Gas Analyzer (UGGA) at the surface of Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR) and Beaverdam Reservoir (BVR; Vinton, Virginia, USA). FCR and BVR are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority as drinking water sources for Roanoke, Virginia. The dataset consists of calculated diffusive fluxes of methane and carbon dioxide measured at the deepest site of the reservoir adjacent to the dam (2018–2025) and additional reservoir upstream sites in FCR (2018, 2023) and BVR (2022). In 2025, two littoral sites were measured at the northernmost wetland inflow to FCR. Measurements were collected approximately fortnightly in FCR throughout the summer stratified periods of 2018–2021 and 2023-2025, while measurements from BVR were only taken in 2018 and 2022-2024.</para>

          <para>Method description:</para>
          <para>Diffusive fluxes for methane and carbon dioxide were collected using the floating chamber method (Galfalk et al. 2013; McClure et al. 2020). Following McClure et al. (2020), the flux chamber was constructed using an opaque bucket fitted with foam and wrapped with reflective aluminum tape to prevent internal heating. The volume of the bucket was 0.02 meters cubed with an area of 0.15 meters squared. The fitted foam allowed the chamber to sit approximately 3 cm below the water surface and sealed the inside of the chamber from the surrounding air. The chamber was connected to a Los Gatos ultraportable GHG analyzer (UGGA: Los Gatos Research Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) through two air-tight gas ports which were fitted to the top of the chamber and connected to two separate three-meter sections of 0.635-cm Tygon PVC tubing before being connected to the inlet and waste valves on the UGGA. Air was circulated through the chamber at approximately 405 mL per minute. The moisture corrected methane and carbon dioxide (ppm) were recorded every 10 seconds. The chamber was vented until atmospheric concentrations were reached before being lowered to the water’s surface. This was done before and after each sampling occurrence. The chamber collected data on the water’s surface for 3-5 minutes. This was typically repeated twice at each site for two replicate measurements per sampling occurrence.</para>
          <para>Diffusive fluxes for methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were calculated from the collected UGGA concentrations using the FluxCalR package (Zhao, 2019). Briefly, peaks for methane concentration were visually identified for each day and each replicate, which served as the end time point for slope calculation (for both CO2 and CH4). The slopes of carbon dioxide and methane concentrations were then calculated for 3-5 minutes prior to the identified end time point. The slope was converted to diffusive flux assuming 1 atmosphere of pressure and averaging the ambient temperature over the entire measurement period. Because fluxes were identified as the rate of increase in gas concentration over time, poor linear fits imply substantial uncertainty in the calculated flux. In this data package, all fluxes with R2 &lt; 0.9 have been flagged, and we recommend exercising caution when interpreting/using these fluxes.</para>
          <para>
Data considerations:</para>
          <para>There was an issue with the UGGA internal clock in 2022. Start times for these measurements have been set to 12:00, as sampling occurred between 10 AM and 2 PM. End times have been set to 12:00 plus the duration of the sampling interval (3-5 min). Therefore, the difference between end time and start time correctly indicates the sampling duration. These measurements have been flagged with a "1" in the Flag_Start_time and Flag_End_time columns of the dataset.</para>
          <para>In 2024, there were issues with the external power battery so some casts, especially at BVR, were cut short. We replaced the external battery in August 2024. Starting in November 2024, we were unable to take measurements at BVR due to construction at the dam and modified access to the water. </para>
          <para>See site_descriptions.csv provided in this data package for further information regarding sampling sites. All data were collected in local time, meaning that the time zone alternated between Eastern Daylight Savings Time (summer months) and Eastern Standard Time (winter months).</para>
          <para>This data package includes data with calculated fluxes (ugga_2018_2025.csv), a QAQC R script (ugga_qaqc_2018_2025.R), a visual inspection R script (ugga_inspection_2018_2025.Rmd), sampling sites (site_descriptions.csv), a maintenance log file (ugga_maintenancelog_2018_2024.csv), a data processing script (ugga_FluxCalR_2025.R), and raw data files for 2024 (RawData.zip). See previous revisions of this data package for historical raw data files and data processing code. </para>
