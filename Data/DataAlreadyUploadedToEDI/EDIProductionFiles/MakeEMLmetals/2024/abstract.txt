Depth profiles of total and soluble metals were sampled from 2014-2023 in three drinking-water reservoirs, Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR) Beaverdam Reservoir (BVR), and Carvins Cove Reservoir (CCR). FCR and BVR are located in Vinton, Virginia, USA and CCR is located in Roanoke, Virginia, USA.  Only Fe and Mn were analyzed from 2014-2019. The full suite of metals (Li, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Fe, Mn, Cu, Sr, Ba) were analyzed from 2020-2023. All reservoirs are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority and are managed as secondary drinking-water sources for the city of Roanoke, VA. The dataset includes metals samples that were collected along a depth profile taken at the deepest site of each reservoir near the dam. Additional samples were collected at a gauged weir located on the primary inflow tributary, as well as at a secondary tributary, to FCR. A 2022 sampling campaign at CCR included inflows and a depth profile at the deepest site. Sampling frequency in 2023 was approximately weekly during the summer and fall (May - October), approximately fortnightly during the spring (March - April), and approximately monthly during the winter (November - March). For previous sampling campaign frequencies, please see past revisions of this data product.
