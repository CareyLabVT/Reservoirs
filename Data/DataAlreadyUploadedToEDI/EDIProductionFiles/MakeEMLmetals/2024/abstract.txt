Depth profiles of total and soluble metals were sampled from 2014-2023 in two drinking-water reservoirs, Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR) and Beaverdam Reservoir (BVR), located in Vinton, Virginia, USA.  Only Fe and Mn were analyzed from 2014-2019. The full suite of metals (Li, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Fe, Mn, Cu, Sr, Ba) were analyzed from 2020-2023. Both reservoirs are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority and are managed as secondary drinking-water sources for the city of Roanoke, VA. The dataset includes metals samples that were collected along a depth profile taken at the deepest site of the reservoir near the dam. Additional samples were collected at a gauged weir located on the primary inflow tributary, as well as at a secondary tributary, to Falling Creek Reservoir. Sampling frequency was approximately weekly during the summer and fall (May - October), approximately fortnightly during the spring (March - April), and approximately monthly during the winter (November - March).
