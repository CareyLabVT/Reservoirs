Contributions to the 2022 revision:
MES initiated metals sampling at Falling Creek Reservoir and Beaverdam Reservoir in 2014, and at Carvins Cove Reservoir in 2022. CLM served as the point person for data cleaning, analysis and QAQC from fall 2022 to present. CLM scripted the automation of raw data processing into publishable form with assistance from NWH. ABP led field crew and sampling efforts at all three reservoirs in 2022. NWH, BG and GH contributed substantially to preparation and sampling for field campaigns.

Acknowledgments and historical contributions:
This data package has been iteratively updated over time and builds on the many historical contributions of co-authors listed in previous revisions. We thank the Western Virginia Water Authority for providing access to these sites, the Reservoir Group for contributing to fieldwork, and Gavin Moore for organizing samples in summer 2022.
