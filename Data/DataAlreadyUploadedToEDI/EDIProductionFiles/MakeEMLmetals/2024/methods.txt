WATER COLUMN SAMPLING: We collected water samples for total and soluble Fe and Mn concentrations from Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR) and  Beaverdam Reservoir (BVR) approximately fortnightly from March-April, weekly from May-October, and monthly from November-February. We sampled Carvins Cove Reservoir (CCR) approximately fortnightly from May-October 2022.   Water samples were collected at the deepest site of each reservoir using a 4-L Van Dorn sampler (Wildlife Supply Company, Yulee, FL). In FCR, water samples were collected at specified depths ranging from 0.1 m to 9.8 m. Additional water samples were collected from the primary inflow tributary as well as a secondary tributary. In BVR, water samples were collected at specified depths ranging from 0.1 m to 12.0 m. Additional samples were collected at an upstream site at specified depths from 0.1 m to 4 m . In CCR, water samples were collected at specified depths ranging from 0.1 m to 21 m. Additional samples were collected at several tributaries. After collection, we poured raw water samples directly from the Van Dorn sampler into sample bottles for total metal analyses and we syringe-filtered water using 0.45 micron nylon filters into bottles for soluble metal analyses. All samples were preserved using trace metal grade nitric acid to pH less than 2. 
SAMPLING TIMES: Most sampling occurred between the hours of 9:00 and 15:00. Some sampling occurred outside of these hours, including some overnight sampling; these instances are noted by the actual sampling time within the DateTime column. Samples with no exact sampling time recorded are reported as 12:00 in the DateTime column and flagged with a '1' in the Flag_DateTime column. Samples were collected in the America/New York Eastern Time Zone, which observed daylight savings time from approximately March to November in 2014-2022.

CHEMICAL ANALYSIS: In 2014-2015, samples were analyzed for Fe and Mn using an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS; Thermo Electron X-Series) following APHA Standard Method 3125-B (American Public Health Association et al., 1998).  Detection limits for Fe and Mn were 0.0008 mg/L and 0.0005 mg/L, respectively, in 2014 and 0.0012 mg/L and 0.00007 mg/L, respectively, in 2015.  In 2016-2019, samples were analyzed for Fe and Mn using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) using a Spectro ARCOS SOP (Side-On Plasma interface) instrument using methods similar to EPA 200.7 (EPA, 1994). During 2016-2019, detection limits for Fe and Mn were 0.004 mg/L and 0.001 mg/L, respectively. Starting in 2020, samples were analyzed for Fe and Mn using an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS; Thermo Electron iCAP-RQ) following APHA Standard Method 3125-B (American Public Health Association et al., 1998). In 2020-2022, detection limits for Fe and Mn were 0.0004 mg/L and 0.00003 mg/L, respectively. The minimum reporting levels for Fe and Mn were 0.005 mg/L and 0.0001 mg/L, respectively. We used the minimum reporting levels as the lower threshold for data in 2020-2022. Values that were below the minimum detection limit (for 2014-2019) or minimum reporting level (for 2020-2022) were set to the value of the minimum detection limit or minimum reporting level. Negative values were set to 0.
