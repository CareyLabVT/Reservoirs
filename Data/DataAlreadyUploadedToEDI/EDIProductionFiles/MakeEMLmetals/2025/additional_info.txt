Contributions to the 2023 revision:
MES oversaw the metals sampling program at Falling Creek Reservoir and Beaverdam Reservoir in 2014-present, and at Carvins Cove Reservoir in 2022. CEW served as the point person for data cleaning, analysis, and QAQC in 2023. CEW and ABP automated the data processing with CEB. ABP led field crew and sampling efforts at all three reservoirs, and wrote the visual inspection script. CEW and CEB contributed to fieldwork and digested select samples with assistance from MES. GH, MK, RK, and ET contributed to fieldwork, data digitization, and field monitoring preparations.
