WATER COLUMN SAMPLING: We collected water samples for total and soluble metal concentrations from Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR) and Beaverdam Reservoir (BVR) approximately fortnightly from March-April, weekly from May-October, and monthly from November-February. In 2022, we collected water samples from CCR approximately fortnightly during summer (May-October). Water samples were collected at various depths at the deepest site of each reservoir using a 4-L Van Dorn sampler (Wildlife Supply Company, Yulee, FL). In FCR, water samples were collected at specified depths ranging from 0.1 m to 9.8 m. Additional water samples were collected from the primary inflow tributary as well as a secondary tributary. In BVR, water samples were collected at specified depths ranging from 0.1 m to 12.0 m. In CCR, water samples were collected at specified depths ranging from 0.1 m to 21 m. Additional samples were collected at several tributaries. After collection, we poured raw water samples directly from the Van Dorn sampler into sample bottles for total metal analyses and we syringe-filtered water using 0.45 micron nylon filters into bottles for soluble metal analyses. All samples were preserved using trace metal grade nitric acid to pH less than 2. 


SAMPLING TIMES: Most sampling occurred between the hours of 9:00 and 15:00. Some sampling occurred outside of these hours, including some overnight sampling; these instances are noted by the actual sampling time within the DateTime column. Samples with no exact sampling time recorded are reported as 12:00 in the DateTime column and flagged with a '1' in the Flag_DateTime column. Samples were collected in the America/New York Eastern Time Zone, which observed daylight savings time from approximately March to November in 2014-2023.


CHEMICAL ANALYSIS: In 2014-2015, samples were analyzed for Fe and Mn using an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS; Thermo Electron X-Series) following APHA Standard Method 3125-B (American Public Health Association et al., 1998).  Detection limits for Fe and Mn were 0.0008 mg/L and 0.0005 mg/L, respectively, in 2014 and 0.0012 mg/L and 0.00007 mg/L, respectively, in 2015.  In 2016-2019, samples were analyzed for Fe and Mn using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) using a Spectro ARCOS SOP (Side-On Plasma interface) instrument using methods similar to EPA 200.7 (EPA, 1994). Detection limits for Fe and Mn were 0.004 mg/L and 0.001 mg/L, respectively. Starting in 2020, samples were analyzed for Li, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Fe, Mn, Cu, Sr, and Ba using an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS; Thermo Electron iCAP-RQ) following APHA Standard Method 3125-B (American Public Health Association et al., 1998). Please see the list  at the bottom of the methods for the minimum reporting levels for Fe, Mn, Li, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Cu, Sr, and Ba from 2020-2023. We used the minimum reporting levels as the lower threshold for data in 2020-2023. Values that were below the minimum detection limit (for 2014-2019) or minimum reporting level (for 2020-2023) were flagged as '3' and set to the value of the minimum detection limit or minimum reporting level. Negative values were flagged as '4' and set to 0 in 2014-2019 and were set to the minimum reporting level in 2020-2023. 

	Abnormally high concentrations were defined as greater than three standard deviations above the mean, were flagged as '8', and retained the value. As a result, some soluble samples reported higher concentrations than the total samples. 

	Occasionally, unfiltered samples contain particulates. As particulates cannot be analyzed using ICPMS, samples with particulates were first microwave-digested with concentrated trace metal grade nitric acid (modified from EPA 3015a) prior to analysis and are flagged with a '6'. Please see Metals_maintenancelog_2014_2023 for more information about specific samples.

OTHER FLAG DESCRIPTIONS: If a sample was analyzed multiple times, then the values are averaged and flagged as '7'. To check if total and soluble samples were mistakenly switched prior to analysis, the QAQC script (Metals_qaqc_2020_2023.R) checks the total and soluble concentrations of Fe, Mn, and Al. If soluble concentrations are higher than total concentrations for all three metals, then the total and soluble concentrations are switched for all metals for that specific sample and flagged as '9'. If the authors identified samples that were processed improperly, values were set to NA and flagged as '10'. All flags are either in the maintenance log or identified with the QAQC script. Please contact the authors of the data package for more information. 

DATA ANALYSIS: This data package includes 2 data files (Metals_2014_2023.csv), QAQC R script (Metals_qaqc_2020_2023.R), maintenance log (Metals_maintenancelog_2014_2023.csv), visual inspection R script (Metals_Inspection_2014_2023.Rmd), sampling sites (site_descriptions.csv). The QAQC script includes functions to process data, remove outliers, and apply the maintenance log to clean the data files included in the package; the visual inspection script provides code for plotting the data files.


	Multiple whole-ecosystem experiments have been conducted at Falling Creek Reservoir, including intermittent operation of hypolimnetic oxygenation (HOx) and pulsed epilimnetic mixing (EM) engineering systems. We encourage you to contact the lead author of the data package for more information.
