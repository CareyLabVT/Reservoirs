Depth profiles of total and soluble iron and manganese were sampled from 2014-2020 in two drinking-water reservoirs, Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR) and Beaverdam Reservoir (BVR), located in Vinton, Virginia, USA. Both reservoirs are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority and are managed as secondary drinking-water sources for the city of Roanoke, VA. The dataset includes metals samples that were collected along a depth profile taken at the deepest site of the reservoir near the dam. Additional samples were collected at a gauged weir located on the primary inflow tributary to Falling Creek Reservoir. Sampling frequency was approximately weekly during the summer and fall (May - October), approximately fortnightly during the spring (March - April), and approximately monthly during the winter (November - March).
