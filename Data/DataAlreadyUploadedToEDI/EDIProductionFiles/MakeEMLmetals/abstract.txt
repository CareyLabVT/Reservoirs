Depth profiles of total and soluble iron and manganese were sampled from 2014-2022 in three drinking-water reservoirs, Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR), Beaverdam Reservoir (BVR), and Carvins Cove Reservoir (CCR). FCR and BVR are located in Vinton, Virginia, USA and CCR is located in Roanoke, Virginia, USA. All reservoirs are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority and are managed as drinking-water sources for the city of Roanoke, Virginia, USA. The dataset includes metals samples that were collected along a depth profile taken at the deepest site of BVR and FCR. At FCR, additional samples were collected at a gauged weir located on the primary inflow tributary and at a secondary tributary. The summer 2022 sampling campaign also included inflows and a depth profile of CCR, and an upstream site at BVR. At FCR and BVR, sampling frequency was approximately weekly during the summer and fall (May - October), approximately fortnightly during the spring (March - April), and approximately monthly during the winter (November - March). At CCR, sampling frequency was approximately fortnightly during summer (May - October).
