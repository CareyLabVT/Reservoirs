WATER COLUMN SAMPLING: We collected water samples for total and soluble Fe and Mn concentrations from Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR) and  Beaverdam Reservoir (BVR) approximately fortnightly from March-April, weekly from May-October, and monthly from November-February.   Water samples were collected at the deepest site of each reservoir using a 4-L Van Dorn sampler (Wildlife Supply Company, Yulee, FL). In FCR, water samples were collected at specified depths ranging from 0.1 m to 9.8 m. Additional water samples were collected from the primary inflow tributary. In BVR, water samples were collected at specified depths ranging from 0.1 m to 12.0 m. After collection, we poured raw water samples directly from the Van Dorn sampler into sample bottles for total metal analyses and we syringe-filtered water using 0.45 micron nylon filters into bottles for soluble metal analyses. Total and soluble samples for metal analysis were preserved using 0.5 mL trace metal grade nitric acid to a pH less than 2. 

SAMPLING TIMES: Most sampling occurred between the hours of 9:00 and 15:00. Some sampling occurred outside of these hours, including some overnight sampling; these instances are noted by the actual sampling time within the DateTime column.

CHEMICAL ANALYSIS: In 2014-2015, samples were analyzed for Fe and Mn using an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS; Thermo Electron X-Series) following APHA Standard Method 3125-B (American Public Health Association et al., 1998).  Detection limits for Fe and Mn were 0.0008 mg/L and 0.0005 mg/L, respectively, in 2014 and 0.0012 mg/L and 0.00007 mg/L, respectively, in 2015.  Starting in 2016, samples were analyzed for Fe and Mn using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) using a Spectro ARCOS SOP (Side-On Plasma interface) instrument using methods similar to EPA 200.7 (EPA, 1994).  Detection limits for Fe and Mn were 0.004 mg/L and 0.001 mg/L, respectively, for 2016-2019.
