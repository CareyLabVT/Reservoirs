This is a template to make your visual inspection script. It does not have to be an R Markdown but I like then especially the knit function so I can send the plots to coauthors. Make sure all of the columns get plotted even ones you think might not be that relevant. 

## R Markdown Guide

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

```{r setup packages, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Add the names of the packages 
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, lubridate, gsheet)
```



```{r Read in Historical files from EDI}

inUrl1  <- ADD PASTA FROM EDI HERE
infile1 <- tempfile()
try(download.file(inUrl1,infile1,method="curl"))
if (is.na(file.size(infile1))) download.file(inUrl1,infile1,method="auto")

                   
 historic <-read_csv(infile1)

```


```{r Read in L1 file}

L1 <- read_csv(LINK TO L1 FILE HERE)

```

```{r Bind historic and L1 files together}

current_df <- dplyr::bind_rows(historic, L1)

```

This section checks to make sure each observation has a data flag. It also checks to make sure the frequency of flags match what we expect to see. 

```{r Check there are no NAs in Flag columns}

#make sure no NAS in the Flag columns
Flags=current_df%>%
  select(DateTime, starts_with("Flag"))

RowsNA=Flags[!complete.cases(Flags), ] # Keep only the complete rows

#check the flag column
Flags=current_df%>%
  select(starts_with("Flag"))

# Make a table with the number of times a flag was used
for(f in 1:(ncol(Flags))){
  #print(colnames(Flags[f]))
  print(table(Flags[,f], useNA = "always"))
}

```

```{r Plots}

```

```{r Make new CSV with current and historic files}

# Need to decide on a naming convention for this file
write.csv(current_df, "Variable_startYear_EndYear.csv", row.names = F)

```

```{r Make site description file}
 # These lines of code make the csv of the site descriptions with lat and long

  # Use Gsheet because you don't need to authenticate it. 
  sites <- gsheet::gsheet2tbl("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TlQRdjmi_lzwFfQ6Ovv1CAozmCEkHumDmbg_L4A2e-8/edit#gid=1244423834")
  #data<- read_csv("YOUR DATA.csv")# Use this if you read in a csv
  data <- current_df #This is the line you need to modify!
  trim_sites = function(data,sites){
    data_res_site=data%>% #Create a Reservoir/Site combo column
      mutate(res_site = trimws(paste0(Reservoir,Site)))
    sites_merged = sites%>% #Filter to Sites that are in the dataframe
      mutate(res_site = trimws(paste0(Reservoir,Site)))%>%
      filter(res_site%in%data_res_site$res_site)%>%
      select(-res_site)
  }
  sites_trimmed = trim_sites(data,sites) 
  write.csv(sites_trimmed,"site_descriptions.csv", row.names=F)# Write to file

```
