This is a template to make your visual inspection script. It does not have to be an R Markdown but I like then especially the knit function so I can send the plots to coauthors. Make sure all of the columns get plotted even ones you think might not be that relevant. 

## R Markdown Guide

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

```{r setup packages, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Add the names of the packages 
```



```{r Read in Historical files from EDI}

inUrl1  <- ADD PASTA FROM EDI HERE
infile1 <- tempfile()
try(download.file(inUrl1,infile1,method="curl"))
if (is.na(file.size(infile1))) download.file(inUrl1,infile1,method="auto")

                   
 historic <-read_csv(infile1)

```


```{r Read in L1 file}

L1 <- read_csv(LINK TO L1 FILE HERE)

```

```{r Bind historic and L1 files together}

current_df <- bind_rows(historic, L1)

```

This section checks to make sure each observation has a data flag. It also checks to make sure the frequency of flags match what we expect to see. 

```{r Check there are no NAs in Flag columns}

#make sure no NAS in the Flag columns
Flags=current_df%>%
  select(DateTime, starts_with("Flag"))

RowsNA=Flags[!complete.cases(Flags), ] # Keep only the complete rows

#check the flag column
Flags=current_df%>%
  select(starts_with("Flag"))

# Make a table with the number of times a flag was used
for(f in 1:(ncol(Flags))){
  #print(colnames(Flags[f]))
  print(table(Flags[,f], useNA = "always"))
}

```

```{r Plots}

```
