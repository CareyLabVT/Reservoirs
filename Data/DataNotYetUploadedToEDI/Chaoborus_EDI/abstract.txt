It has recently been proposed that Chaoborus spp. may increase methane (CH4) concentrations in the epilimnion by transporting CH4 from the sediments to the epilimnia of lakes and reservoirs. It is proposed they do this by taking up CH4 in their tracheal gas sacs, using this buoyancy to reach surface waters, and then releasing the CH4 near the surface. We tested the hypothesis that Chaoborus transport methane (CH4) through the water column of freshwater reservoir using diel surveys and seasonal monitoring, as well as incubations of Chaoborus. To do this, we measured the CH4 transported in their gas sacs at different depths and times twice, once during a 24 hr period in August and a second 24 hr period in September, 2017.
