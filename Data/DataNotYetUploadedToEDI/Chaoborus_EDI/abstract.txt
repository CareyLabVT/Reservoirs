It has recently been proposed that Chaoborus spp. may increase methane (CH4) concentrations in the epilimnion by transporting CH4 from the sediments to the epilimnia of lakes and reservoirs. It is proposed they do this by taking up CH4 in their tracheal gas sacs, using this buoyancy to reach surface waters, and then releasing the CH4 near the surface. We tested the hypothesis that Chaoborus transport methane (CH4) through the water column of freshwater reservoir using diel surveys and seasonal monitoring, as well as incubations of Chaoborus. To do this, we measured the CH4 transported in their gas sacs at different depths and times twice, once during a 24 hr period in August and a second 24 hr period in September, 2017.

POSSIBLE SECOND DRAFT?
Depth profiles of water column dissolved methane (CH4), density and biomass of zooplankton (specifically, Chaoborus spp.), and measurements of methane extracted from the tracheal gas sacs of Chaoborus spp. were collected from Beaverdam Reservoir, Vinton, VA, USA during two, 24-hr intensive sampling efforts in fall 2016 (3-4 August and 16-17 September). The sampling campaign was designed to test the hypothesis that Chaoborus spp. can transport CH4 from the hypolimnion to the epilimnion of lakes and reservoirs as they migrate to the surface waters from the benthos at night in search of zooplankton prey, and results of the project are published in Carey et al. 2018. During both sampling events, depth profiles of water column methane and Chaoborus spp. density were collected at noon, dusk, midnight, 2 a.m., dawn, and noon the following day at a 1 m resolution. In addition, during the September sampling event depth profiles were collected 1 hour prior to and after dusk. Methane gas was extracted from live Chaoborus individuals at every depth and time point immediately after collection via gentle centrifugation in distilled water following McGinnis et al. 2017.
