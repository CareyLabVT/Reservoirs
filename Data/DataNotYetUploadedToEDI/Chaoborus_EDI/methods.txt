SUMMARY: 
Chaoborus spp., water column dissolved methane concentrations, and methane contained in the gas sacs of Chaoborus were sampled in Beaverdam Reservoir (BVR) throughout the diel periods of 3-4 August and 16-17 September 2016. This data product includes collected meter-resolution depth profiles of Chaoborus and methane (CH4), at noon, dusk, midnight, 2 a.m., dawn, and then noon the next day as well as measurements of methane extracted from Chaoborus at every depth and time point.  Sunset and sunrise times for 3-4 August were approximately 20:30 and 6:00, respectively, and 20:00 and 6:30 for 16-17 September. On the second sampling event (16?17 September), we collected additional profiles at 1 h before and after dusk for more finely resolved Chaoborus and CH4 profiles. 

WATER COLUMN DISSOLVED METHANE:
CH4 samples were collected with a Van Dorn sampler every meter in the water column from subsurface (0.1 m) to just above the sediments at 11 m. Water samples were transferred from the Van Dorn into two replicate 20 mL serum vials, capped without headspace, and kept on ice until analysis within 24 h using a GC-FID following standard methods (McClure et al 2018; Carey et al 2020). 

CHAOBORUS SAMPLING:
Profiles of Chaoborus were collected every meter from the surface to 10 m using a 30 L Schindler trap (Doubek et al 2019; Carey et al 2018); 11 m was not sampled to prevent submerging the Schindler trap in the sediments. All Schindler trap samples were collected in <30 s, the duration from when the trap was closed with a messenger at depth to when the trap was raised to the water’s surface and poured into an opaque sample bottle. All Chaoborus collected at night were kept in near-complete darkness from the time of collection to the beginning of the incubations to limit any light effects. After incubation for methane extraction (see below), Chaoborus were preserved in 70% ethanol. In the lab, Chaoborus densities were calculated following Downing and Rigler 1984. <BEEF UP W/ METHODS FROM JONS ZOOP PUBLICATION ONCE EDI DATA PORTAL IS BACK UP>

METHANE EXTRACTED FROM CHAOBORUS:
At every sampling time, we measured the CH4 released from Chaoborus with methods adapted from McGinnis et al 2017. Immediately after collection (see above), the Chaoborus were transported to a mobile lab set up onshore. We immediately separated Chaoborus into counting trays, discarded any individuals not in their third or fourth instar stage, and then rinsed, counted, and gently added Chaoborus to 125 mL Erlenmeyer flasks. The Chaoborus were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water pre-equilibrated to atmospheric CH4 concentrations to prevent high-CH4 water from contaminating the flasks.  The flasks had a magnetic stir bar and were filled with 100 mL of equilibrated distilled water. Each flask was tightly capped with a rubber septum stopper and placed on a stir plate, where Chaoborus were mixed at 60 rpm for 60 min to release any gas in their tracheal sacs and equilibrate CH4 concentrations in the water with the headspace. The total duration of time from Chaoborus collection in the reservoir to the beginning of the incubations was approximately 10-30 min, and much care was taken to limit any unnecessary Chaoborus handling. After 60 min, 30 mL of gas were removed from the flask headspace using a syringe and injected into a serum vial that was kept on ice until analysis within 24 h. All flasks were thoroughly cleaned with atmosphere-equilibrated distilled water between incubations. 

ANCILLARY DATASETS:
Additionally, From 6 April to 11 November 2016, Beaverdam Reservoir was sampled fortnightly during the daytime to compare the seasonal pattern of Chaoborus and CH4 throughout the summer stratified period with the diel sampling. On each sampling date, we collected approximately 0.1 m resolution depth profiles of temperature and DO concentrations using a 4-Hz SBE 19plus CTD profiler with an SBE 43 DO sensor (SeaBird Electronics, Bellevue, WA; Carey et al. 2020). We also quantified the daytime density of Chaoborus in the water column with 74-m mesh vertical net tows from 0.5 m above the sediments to the surface, which were preserved and analyzed as described above for Chaoborus samples (Carey et al. 2018). Finally, on every sample day, we measured depth profiles of dissolved CH4 concentrations in the water column at five depths (0.1, 3, 6, 9, and 11 m), following the methods described above (Carey et al. 2020 GHG EDI ref).
