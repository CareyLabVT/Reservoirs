Field Notes Flora
Notes from the field crew about wonky or missing casts

2025:
2025-03-17 FCR 50 - deleted most of the cast when processing the file in bbe+ software, so just calling this missing. 
2025-11-13 - looking at the casts after daylight savings, I don't think the instrument changed and is still in EDT
