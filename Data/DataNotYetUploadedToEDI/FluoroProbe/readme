Each file is a single profile, downcast only, that has been viewed and cleaned in bbe++. The cleaning process is done manually; 
observations with a depth ~< 0.2 are removed due to quenching, as well as depths at the bottom of the downcast that appear to have reduced
transmission and might be less accurate because of excessive particulate matter. Right now, the threshold for "reduced transmission" is decided
subjectively, but generally means a 3-5% reduction in transmission compared to the observation immediately above it. 

The naming protocol is: yyyymmdd_RESERVOIR_site.csv
50 = deep hole
45,30,20,10 = upstream sites in FCR only

FCR = Falling Creek Reservoir
BVR = Beaverdam Reservoir
CCR = Carvins Cove Reservoir
