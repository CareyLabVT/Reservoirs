Files in the Files_dont_follow_key folder are files that don't have a date assigned to them in the first column of the data frame. 
We are not sure that they follow the numbering system as the key so we are leaving then in this folder and they should not be used when running the metals_qaqc script,
as they will be labeled with the wrong site identifiers. 

These data are included in the file historic_raw_2014_2019_w_unique_samp_campaign.csv, where the site name and depth has already been added to the file manually.
