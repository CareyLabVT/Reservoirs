Depth profiles of multiple water-quality variables were collected from 2013 through 2023 using a Conductivity, Temperature and Depth (CTD) profiler from SeaBird Electronics (SBE, Bellevue Washington, USA) at five reservoirs. Beaverdam Reservoir, Carvins Cove Reservoir, and Falling Creek Reservoir were sampled every year in the dataset (2013-2023); Spring Hollow Reservoir was only sampled 2013-2017 and 2019; and Gatewood Reservoir was only sampled in 2016. Within their sampling duration, profiles were collected, at minimum, monthly between May to October (usually weekly or subweekly at Beaverdam Reservoir and Falling Creek Reservoir), and bimonthly between November to April. Most CTD casts were collected from 9:00 to 15:00, however, some CTD casts were collected at night. Above water temperature and PAR are included in the dataset for 2018â€“2023, and are denoted with a negative depth measurement that indicates the distance above the surface of the reservoir.

The CTD was calibrated by the manufacturer according to the standards and practices of SBE and the companies with secondary sensors coupled to the instrument. Calibration was performed yearly (usually in December-February), except during/before the 2021 field season when calibration was delayed until August 2021 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Flags indicate known or suspected issues with measured variables. We note that the Depth_m likely also includes marginal error over the course of the dataset, but this error is unquantified and unflagged. Due to the challenges of measuring pH, ORP, and turbidity in situ, we recommend caution in interpreting these data.

Additional Notes

Multiple whole-ecosystem experiments have been conducted at Falling Creek Reservoir, including intermittent operation of hypolimnetic oxygenation (HOx) and pulsed epilimnetic mixing (EM) engineering systems. We encourage you to contact the lead author of the data package for more information.
