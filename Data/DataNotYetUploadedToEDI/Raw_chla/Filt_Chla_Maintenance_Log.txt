# Title: Filtered Chla Maintenance Log
# Here is a template the the Maintenance Log. Any questions let Adrienne know. 
# THIS FILE IS READ IN AS A CSV MEANING DO NOT PUT ANY COMMAS IN THE NOTES SECTION
# Make sure to fill out all the columns even if it just with an NA. 

### Description of the columns
# Date_processed = The date the samples were run on the spec

# ResSite = The name of the reservoir and Site combined with the inital of the Reservoir and the number of the site
# Eg. F50 = FCR 50, B50 = BVR 50 

# DataStream = Nickname for each of data package. 
# Eg. Flora, CTD, YSI, Secchi, GHG, Metals, SedTraps, UGGA, FiltChla, Weir, Ice, EddyFlux

# Rep = Is the sample a duplicate or not. If it is a duplicate it will be labeled DUP

# Sample.ID = Name of sample used for running the sample. It is made up of a number an underscore followed by b
# for before acid or a for after acid

# Sample_date = The date the chla sample was collected

# start_parameter = The name of the first column of the affected observation. Use the name of the column 
# you use in the L1 script. 

# end_parameter = The name of the last column of the affected observations. Use the name of the column
# you use in the L1 scipt. If you are only selecting one column put the same column name in the start_parameter
# and the end_parameter. You can also put NA. 

# flag = the number flag associated with the maintenance. Each datapackage has their own set of flags. 

# notes = a description of why the values were removed or changed. Provide as much detail as necessary for 
# co authors and people who will use your data package. DO NOT INCLUDE COMMAS IN THE NOTES SECTION.
