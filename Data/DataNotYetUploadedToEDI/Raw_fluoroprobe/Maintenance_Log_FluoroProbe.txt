# Title: Template for Maintenance Log
# Here is a template the the Maintenance Log. Any questions let Adrienne know. 
# THIS FILE IS READ IN AS A CSV MEANING DO NOT PUT ANY COMMAS IN THE NOTES SECTION
# Make sure to fill out all the columns even if it just with an NA. 

### Description of the columns
# Reservoir= This is the 3 character code used to identify each reservoir
#    FCR = Falling Creek Reservoir,
#    BVR = Beaverdam Reservoir,
#    CCR = Carvins Cove Reservoir,
    
# Site = The number assigned to the site. Eg. The deep hole is 50 

# Depth = The depth of the sample. If not applicable put NA. This is not used with streaming sensors. 

# DataStream = Nickname for each of data package. 
# Eg. Flora, CTD, YSI, Secchi, GHG, Metals, SedTraps, UGGA, FiltChla, Weir, Ice, EddyFlux

# TIMESTAMP_start = The starting time for the observation or observations you want removed or changed. 
# Please use the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS and indicate the timezone either EST or EDT. Since the streaming
# sensors are in EST all my times in the maintenance log are in EST. 

# TIMESTAMP_end = The ending time for the observation or observation you want removed or changed. 
# See above for formatting. 
# If the maintenance does not have an end time put NA. 

# start_parameter = The name of the first column of the affected observation. Use the name of the column 
# you use in the L1 script. 

# end_parameter = The name of the last column of the affected observations. Use the name of the column
# you use in the L1 scipt. If you are only selecting one column put the same column name in the start_parameter
# and the end_parameter. You can also put NA. 

# flag = the number flag associated with the maintenance. Each datapackage has their own set of flags. 

# update_value = the value to change an observation to or if you are using an offset to change an observation. 
# Indicate in the notes if the value is being changed or if it is begin used as an offset. 

# notes = a description of why the values were removed or changed. Provide as much detail as necessary for 
# co authors and people who will use your data package. DO NOT INCLUDE COMMAS IN THE NOTES SECTION.
