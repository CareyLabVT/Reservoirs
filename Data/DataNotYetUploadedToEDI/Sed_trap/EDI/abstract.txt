Sediment traps were deployed to assess the mass and composition (iron, manganese, total organic carbon, and total nitrogen) of settling particulates in the water column of  two drinking water reservoirsâ€”Beaverdam Reservoir and Falling Creek Reservoir, both located in Vinton, Virginia, USA.  Sediment traps were deployed at two depths in each reservoir to capture both epilimnetic and hypolimnetic (total) sediment flux. The particulates were collected from the traps approximately fortnightly from April to December from 2018 to 2022, then filtered, dried, and analyzed for either iron and manganese or total organic carbon and total nitrogen. Beaverdam and Falling Creek are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority as primary or secondary drinking water sources for Roanoke, Virginia.

The sediment trap dataset consists of logs detailing the sample filtering process, the mass of dried particulates from each filter, and the raw concentration data for Fe and Mn (the primary metals of focus), and for total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN), the primary nutrients of focus in the dried solids. The final products are the calculated downward fluxes of solid Fe, Mn, TOC and TN during the deployment periods.
