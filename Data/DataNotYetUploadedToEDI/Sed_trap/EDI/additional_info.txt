Current:

MES has been PI for the sediment trap project since 2014 and has overseen the development of the sampling, lab protocols and data analysis protocol. CEW has led organization, sample filtration and digestion, data analysis, and QAQC from fall 2021 to present. CEW also compiled and organized data from 2016 to present and refined sampling and data analysis protocols. ASL assisted with sample collection during 2019–2022, revised SOPs in 2020, performed CN analysis for 2018–2022 data, and assisted in data compilation, QAQC, and publishing in 2023. ABP led the field crew and has contributed significantly to sampling from 2020 to present. MFV assisted with sample digestion for the 2019 dataset, data processing for the 2021 dataset, and field work in 2022. BRN led and co-led with SOP development from 2014 to 2018, co-analyzed CN from 2014 to present, and assisted with CN data processing in 2016. 


2020-21:

NWH led sampling, sample filtration, and QAQC from 2020 to fall 2021. NWH also digested and processed the 2018 metals dataset.


2019-20:

AGH co-led sample collection in 2019 and led sample collection in 2020. 


2018-19:

MEL co-led sample collection from 2018-2019. MEL also co-authored SOPs for sediment trap collection and sample processing.


2017-18:

RPM led co-led sampling and QAQC in 2017 and 2018. RPM also processed the CN datasets and performed CN analysis from 2017 to 2018. 


2015-17:

RPM and NKW co-led sample collection, analysis, and carbon and nutrient processing in 2016. KMK co-led sampling in 2017, filtered and digested the 2016 and 2017 samples, conducted calculations on the 2016 and 2017 datasets, and authored the metals sample digestion SOP.  


2014-15:

ZWM and ABG led sampling, data analysis, and QAQC from 2014 to 2015. 
ZWM filtered and digested samples and conducted calculations on the 2014 and 2015 metals datasets. 


2013-14:

ABG and CCC worked with WVWA to set up trap collection and oversaw trap deployment from 2013 to 2014. CCC also processed CN samples in 2014.
