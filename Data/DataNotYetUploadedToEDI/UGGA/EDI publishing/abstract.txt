Diffusive fluxes of methane and carbon dioxide were measured using an Ultraportable Greenhouse Gas Analyzer (UGGA) in Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR) and Beaverdam Reservoir (BVR; Vinton, Virginia, USA). FCR and BVR are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority as drinking water sources for Roanoke, Virginia. The dataset consists of calculated diffusive fluxes of methane and carbon dioxide measured at the deepest site of the reservoir adjacent to the dam (2018–2023) and additional reservoir upstream sites in FCR (2018) and BVR (2022). Measurements were collected approximately fortnightly in FCR throughout the summer stratified periods of 2018–2021 and 2023, while measurements from BVR were only taken in 2018, 2022, and 2023.
