Diffusive fluxes for methane and carbon dioxide were collected using the floating chamber method (Galfalk et al. 2013; McClure et al. 2020). Following McClure et al. 2020, the flux chamber was constructed using an opaque bucket fitted with foam and wrapped with reflective aluminum tape to prevent internal heating. The volume of the bucket was 0.02 meters cubed with an area of 0.15 meters squared. The fitted foam allowed the chamber to sit approximately 3 cm below the water surface and sealed the inside of the chamber from the surrounding air. The chamber was connected to a Los Gatos ultraportable GHG analyzer (UGGA: Los Gatos Research Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) through two air-tight gas ports which were fitted to the top of the chamber and connected to two separate three-meter sections of 0.635-cm Tygon PVC tubing before being connected to the inlet and waste valves on the UGGA. Air was circulated through the chamber at approximately 405 mL per minute. The moisture corrected methane and carbon dioxide (ppm) were recorded every 10 seconds. The chamber was vented until atmospheric concentrations were reached before being lowered to the water’s surface. The chamber collected data on the water’s surface for 5 minutes. This was repeated twice at each site for two replicate measurements per sampling occurrence.

Diffusive fluxes for methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were calculated from the collected UGGA concentrations using the FluxCalR package (Zhao, 2019). Briefly, peaks for methane concentration were visually identified for each day and each replicate and served as the end time point for slope calculation (CO2 and CH4, respectively). The slope of carbon dioxide/methane concentration was then calculated for 4 minutes prior to the identified end time point. The slope was converted to diffusive flux assuming 1 atmosphere of pressure and averaging the ambient temperature over the entire measurement period.

There was an issue with the UGGA internal clock in 2022, and times have been removed for these measurements. Sampling occurred during the daytime, between 10 AM and 2 PM.
