Depth profiles of depth, temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, specific conductivity, chlorophyll a, turbidity were collected with a CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth) profiler fitted with a SBE 43 Dissolved Oxygen sensor and an ECO Triplet Fluorometer and Backscattering Sensor from 2013 to 2017. In 2017, pH and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) were also collected with a SBE 27 pH and O.R.P. (redox) sensor. CTD profiles were collected in five drinking water reservoirs in southwestern Virginia, USA. All variables are measured every 0.25 seconds, resulting in depth profiles at  approximately ten centimeter resolution. The five reservoirs are: Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia), Carvins Cove Reservoir (Roanoke, Virginia), Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia), Gatewood Reservoir (Pulaski, Virginia), and Spring Hollow Reservoir (Salem, Virginia). Beaverdam, Carvins Cove, Falling Creek, and Spring Hollow Reservoirs are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority as primary or secondary drinking water sources for Roanoke, Virginia, and Gatewood Reservoir is a drinking water source for the Town of Pulaski, Virginia. The dataset consists of CTD depth profiles measured at the deepest site of each reservoir adjacent to the dam as well as other reservoir sites on a transect upstream in Carvins Cove Reservoir and Falling Creek Reservoir. The profiles were collected approximately fortnightly in the spring months, weekly in the summer and early autumn, and monthly in the late autumn and winter.
