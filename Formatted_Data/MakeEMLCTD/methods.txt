Depth profiles of multiple water-quality variables were collected from 2013 through 2017 using a Conductivity, Temperature and Depth (CTD) profiler from SeaBird Electronics (SBE, Bellevue Washington, USA). Profiles were collected, at minimum, monthly between May to October (usually weekly or subweekly), and bimonthly between November to April. Most CTD casts were collected from 9:00 to 15:00, however, some CTD casts were collected at night.

The CTD was calibrated by the manufacturer yearly (usually in December-February) according to the standards and practices of SBE and the companies with secondary sensors coupled to the instrument. 

Instruments, manual, and serial numbers used between 			2013 - 2017
Multiple sensors and instruments were added over time; below we note changes in the CTD software, sensor versions, and provide links to the accompanying instrument manuals.

From 2013 to 2017, multiple whole-ecosystem manipulations were conducted at Falling Creek Reservoir. These manipulations include intermittent operation of hypolimnetic oxygenation and pulsed epilimnetic mixing engineering systems. For a detailed description of the hypolimnetic oxygenation engineered system, see Gerling et al. (2014) and for a detailed description of the epilimnetic mixing engineered system, see Chen et al. (2017). These systems were operated over time following Table 1 in Gerling et al. (2016), Table 1 in Munger et al. (2016), and Table 2 in McClure et al. (2018).
