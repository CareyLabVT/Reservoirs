Depth profiles of dissolved organic carbon and total and dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus were sampled from 2013 to 2017 in five drinking water reservoirs in southwestern Virginia, USA. These reservoirs are: Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia), Carvins Cove Reservoir (Roanoke, Virginia), Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia), Gatewood Reservoir (Pulaski, Virginia), and Spring Hollow Reservoir (Salem, Virginia). Beaverdam, Carvins Cove, Falling Creek, and Spring Hollow Reservoirs are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority as primary or secondary drinking water sources for Roanoke, Virginia, and Gatewood Reservoir is a drinking water source for the Town of Pulaski, Virginia. The dataset consists of depth profiles of water chemistry samples measured at the deepest site of each reservoir adjacent to the dam. Additional water chemistry samples were collected at a gauged weir on Falling Creek Reservoir's primary inflow tributary. The samples were collected approximately fortnightly from March-April, weekly from May-October, and monthly from November-February.
