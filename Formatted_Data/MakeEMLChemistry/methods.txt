SAMPLING TIMES
Most sampling occurred between the hours of 9:00 and 15:00, and are denoted in the DateTime as 12:00. Some sampling occurred outside of these hours, including some overnight sampling; these instances are noted by the actual sampling time within the DateTime column. For more information about nighttime sampling, see Doubek et. al. 2018.

SAMPLE COLLECTION AND EQUIPMENT

Total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP)

Unfiltered water samples were collected at specified depths for each reservoir using a 4L Van Dorn water sampler (Wildco, Yulee, Florida, USA).  Sample timestamps for samples collected between approximately 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. were standardized to noon. Samples collected for projects that required sample collection at specific times of day were standardized to the top of the hour during which they were collected (i.e., a sample timestamp of 16:00 indicates a sample taken between 4 and 5 p.m.). Samples were stored in acid-washed 125 mL polypropylene bottles and frozen within 12 hours.  Samples were generally analyzed within one year of collection date.

Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate (NO3), ammonium (NH4) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)

Water samples were collected at specified depths for each reservoir using a Van Dorn water sampler and were filtered with a 0.7 _m glass fiber filter (Thomas Scientific GF/F) before being stored in acid-washed 125 mL polypropylene bottles.  Sample timestamps for samples collected between approximately 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. were standardized to noon. Samples collected for projects that required sample collection at specific times of day were standardized to the top of the hour during which they were collected (i.e., a sample timestamp of 16:00 indicates a sample taken between 4 and 5 p.m.). Samples were frozen within 12 hours.  Samples were generally analyzed within six months of collection date. 

CHEMICAL ANALYSES AND EQUIPMENT

TN and TP

Samples were digested with alkaline persulfate (Patton and Kryskalla 2003) and then analyzed colorimetrically using flow injection analysis (APHA 2005).  TN was analyzed using the cadmium reduction method (APHA 1998) and TP was analyzed using the ascorbic acid method (Murphy and Riley 1962) on a Lachat Instruments XYZ Autosampler ASX 520 Series and QuikChem Series 8500 (Lachat ASX 520 Series, Lachat Instruments, Loveland, Colorado, USA). 

SRP, NO3, NH4

Samples were analyzed colorimetrically using flow injection analysis (APHA 2005). SRP was analyzed using the ascorbic acid method (Murphy and Riley 1962), NO3 was analyzed using the cadmium reduction method (APHA 1998), and NH4 was analyzed using the Berthelot Reaction method (Solorzano 1969, APHA 2005) with a common modification as to the source of the hypochlorite ion as described in Zhang et al. 1997 on a Lachat Instruments XYZ Autosampler ASX 520 Series and QuikChem Series 8500 (Lachat ASX 520 Series, Lachat Instruments, Loveland, Colorado, USA).  

DOC

DOC was analyzed using the persulfate catalytic method (Brenton and Arnett 1993) on a TOCA 1010 from OI Analytical from 2013-2016 (OI Analytical 1010 Total Organic Carbon Analyzer with 1051 autosampler, College Station, TX USA) and on a Vario TOC Cube from Elementar from 2016-2017 (vario TOC cube, Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, Hanau, Germany).

ADDITIONAL NOTES
From 2013 to 2017, multiple whole-ecosystem manipulations were conducted at Falling Creek Reservoir. These manipulations include intermittent operation of hypolimnetic oxygenation and pulsed epilimnetic mixing engineering systems. For a detailed description of the hypolimnetic oxygenation engineered system, see Gerling et al. (2014) and for a detailed description of the epilimnetic mixing engineered system, see Chen et al. (2017). These systems were operated over time following Table 1 in Gerling et al. (2016), Table 1 in Munger et al. (2016), and Table 2 in McClure et al. (2018).
