We calculated the daily discharge rate of water in cubic meters per second entering Falling Creek Reservoir through the gauged weir on its primary inflow. We measured the amount of water entering into the reservoir through the weir with an INW Aquistar PT2X pressure sensor (INW, Kirkland, Washington, USA), which recorded the weir water level with a pressure sensor and stream temperature every 15 minutes, except for the time period of 10 June 2013 to 13 June 2013, during which data were recorded hourly. There are additional short time gaps (that have a duration of a few hours maximum) in the 2013 to 2017 record on the days of data downloads, which occurred on: 2013-06-10, 2013-06-13, 2014-06-03, 2014-08-04, 2014-10-04, 2014-12-10, 2015-03-31, 2015-06-08, 2015-08-03, 2015-10-31, 2016-01-11, 2016-04-18, 2016-06-09, 2016-07-14, 2016-10-14, 2017-02-06, 2017-08-28, 2017-11-06, and 2017-12-11. The water level data were then used to calculate the daily flow rate of water entering into the reservoir, following Gerling et al. (2014). References:Gerling, A. B., R. G. Browne, P. A.
