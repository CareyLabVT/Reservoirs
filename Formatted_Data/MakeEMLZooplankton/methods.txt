Crustacean zooplankton and rotifers were collected at the deepest location in each reservoir, close to the dam (coordinates: BVR: 37.313 degrees N, 79.816 degrees W; CCR: 37.371 degrees N, 79.958 degrees W; GWR: 37.043 degrees N, 80.862 degrees W; SHR: 37.231 degrees N, 80.176 degrees W). Zooplankton were collected by 74-micron mesh vertical tow nets (Wildlife Supply Company, Yulee, Florida, USA) approximately fortnightly during the thermally stratified period in 2014-2016 in BVR, CCR, and GWR, and 2014-2015 in SHR. In 2014 and 2015 in BVR, CCR, and GWR, tow nets were lowered to approximately 0.5 m above the bottom lake sediments and pulled up to the surface at a constant speed to collect zooplankton from the full water column. In SHR, zooplankton were only collected from 25-30 m deep to the surface to avoid substantial net catch efficiency issues. In 2016, in addition to the full water column tows in BVR, CCR, and GWR, a second vertical tow was also taken from either 1) the thermocline depth to the nearest meter determined from either a CTD or YSI profile collected at the same time, or the oxycline depth rounded to the nearest meter determined from the CTD or YSI. The second tow was collected in 2016 in these reservoirs to determine zooplankton present in the epilimnion vs. the hypolimnion when the reservoirs were fully oxic, or in the oxic vs. hypoxic parts of the water column in reservoirs experiencing hypolimnetic hypoxia.

In 2016, we also performed 24-hour sampling campaigns to examine the effects of hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations on zooplankton diel vertical migration. Therefore, in addition to vertical tow samples, we also collected 30-L Schindler trap samples. Schindler traps (Wildlife Supply Company, Yulee, Florida, USA) were collected during these sampling events (as well as vertical tows) at noon, dusk, midnight, 2AM, dawn, and noon the following day. The 24-hour sampling campaigns were conducted on 7-8 June and 3-4 August in BVR, 27-28 May and 12-13 August in CCR, and 29-30 April, 26-27 June, and 4-5 September in GWR. Schindler trap samples were collected at each meter in the water column from 0.1 m to a meter just below the thermocline or the oxycline. On the second BVR 24-hour sampling event, we sampled each meter in the water column with the Schindler trap. Zooplankton samples for both vertical net tow and Schindler traps were preserved in 70 percent ethanol.

Zooplankton were identified using a Meiji RZ dissecting microscope (Meiji Techno, San Jose, California, USA) at 50x magnification. Because of the large quantity of samples collected, crustacean zooplankton and rotifers were identified predominantly to the genus level. Daphnia were identified to the species level and cyclopoids were identified to the order level. At least 100 crustacean zooplankton and 100 rotifers were counted for each sample, or until three replicates of each sample were counted. Densities were calculated by scaling counts per subsample to the volume of the vertical net tows from the water column or from the Schindler traps (Downing and Rigler, 1984). All large crustacean zooplankton (Leptodora sp. and Chaoborus sp.) were counted in each sample and then scaled to the volume of the vertical tow net or the volume of the Schindler trap. The first ten individual crustacean zooplankton taxa in each sample were measured and biomass was calculated using published length-weight regressions (Dumont and Balvay, 1979; Downing and Rigler, 1984). Biomass was not calculated for rotifers. If the taxon is not listed for a reservoir on a sampling date, that means that the density, and therefore, its biomass, was 0. Chaoborus and Leptodora were largely only counted for density, not biomass, estimates in 2014 and 2015.

Length-weight regression estimates used to calculate biomass, using ln(a) is the y-intercept and b is the slope. Estimates are summarized in Downing and Rigler (1984). Bosmina: ln(a)=2.7116, b=2.5294; Ceriodaphnia: ln(a)=2.5623, b = 3.3380; Chydorus: ln(a) = 4.543, b = 3.636; Daphnia: ln(a) = 1.54, b = 2.29; Diaphanosoma: ln(a) = 1.2894, b = 3.039; Cyclopoids: ln(a) = 2.2266, b = 3.230; Diaptomus: ln(a) = 1.05, b = 2.46; Leptodora: ln(a) = -0.8220, b = 2.670; Chaoborus: ln(a) = -2.183, b = 3.2345
