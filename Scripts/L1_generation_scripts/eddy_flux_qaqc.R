### Function to create a QAQC plot and
## clean up files produced by LiCor Eddy Pro

## Originally from Alex Hounshell's EddyPro_CleanUp script from 8 October 2021, A. Hounshell

## A. Breef-Pilz updated on 26 Oct. 2022 to included a for loop to
## read in the EddyPro output, create QAQC plots and bind all the files together into on large data frame.
## A. Breef-Pilz modified the script to create a function that reads in the current EddyFlux files
## Makes QAQC plots if they haven't been created,
## then binds current files from the year,
## does a quick QAQC check and then creates an L1 file with all of the current fluxes

# This script runs the function which is sourced from the L1_functions folder
